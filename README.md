[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/getzola/zola/_apis/build/status/getzola.zola?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/getzola/zola/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)
![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/getzola/zola/total)

A fast static site generator in a single binary with everything built-in.

To find out more see the [Zola Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/), look
in the [docs/content](docs/content) folder of this repository or visit the [Zola community forum](https://zola.discourse.group).

This tool and its template engine [tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/) were born from an intense dislike of the (insane) Golang template engine and therefore of
Hugo that I was using before for 6+ sites.
