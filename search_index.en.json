provides support for automatic image resizing through the built-in function resize_image,\nwhich is available in template code as well as in shortcodes.\nThe function usage is as follows:\n\n🔗Arguments\n\n\npath: The path to the source image. The following directories will be searched, in this order:\n\n/ (the root of the project; that is, the directory with your config.toml)\n/static\n/content\n/public\n/themes/current-theme/static\n\n\n\nwidth and height: The dimensions in pixels of the resized image. Usage depends on the op argument.\n\n\nop (optional): Resize operation. This can be one of:\n\n\"scale\"\n\"fit_width\"\n\"fit_height\"\n\"fit\"\n\"fill\"\n\nWhat each of these does is explained below. The default is \"fill\".\n\n\nformat (optional): Encoding format of the resized image. May be one of:\n\n\"auto\"\n\"jpg\"\n\"png\"\n\"webp\"\n\"avif\"\n\nThe default is \"auto\", this means that the format is chosen based on input image format.\nJPEG is chosen for JPEGs and other lossy formats, and PNG is chosen for PNGs and other lossless formats.\n\n\nquality (optional): Quality of the resized image. Quality is only used when encoding JPEGs, WebPs or AVIFs. Quality for JPEG ranges from 1 to 100 and defaults to 75. Quality for WebP ranges from 0 to 100 and defaults to lossless encoding. Quality for AVIF ranges from 1 to 100 and defaults to 80.\n\n\nspeed (optional): Speed of encoding the resized image. Speed is only used when encoding AVIFs. Speed for AVIF ranges from 1 to 10 and defaults to 5. Speed 10 should process images the fastest, but may not produce the best compression; speed 1 is much slower but produces the best compression.\n\n\n🔗Image processing and return value\nZola performs image processing during the build process and places the resized images in a subdirectory in the static files directory:\n\nThe filename of each resized image is a hash of the function arguments,\nwhich means that once an image is resized in a certain way, it will be stored in the above directory and will not\nneed to be resized again during subsequent builds (unless the image itself, the dimensions, or other arguments have changed).\nThe function returns an object with the following schema:\n\n🔗Color and metadata\nAll EXIF, XMP, and IPTC metadata is discarded during processing.\nZola tries to preserve image color space information as much as possible.\nThe following limitations apply:\n\nOnly ICC-based color data is preserved.\nFor WebP, only lossless encoding supports ICC profiles.\nAVIF encoding does not currently support ICC profiles.\n\nIf the color space were to be lost, a warning is printed.\nThe image is converted regardless, without proper color conversion.\nTherefore, if the source color space and the default color space of the target format (usually sRGB or Rec.709) do not match, colors will appear incorrect.\nZola performs image processing on the raw pixel data, without taking the color space into account.\nThis is not usually an issue, but non-linear color spaces (including sRGB, Rec.709, AdobeRGB, Display P3, and non-linear Rec2020) may exhibit imprecise color blending, especially when scaling up low-resolution images.\n🔗Resize operations\nThe source for all examples is this 300 pixel × 380 pixel image:\n\n🔗\"scale\"\nSimply scales the image to the specified dimensions (width &amp; height) irrespective of the aspect ratio.\nresize_image(..., width=150, height=150, op=\"scale\")\n\n\n🔗\"fit_width\"\nResizes the image such that the resulting width is width and height is whatever will preserve the aspect ratio.\nThe height argument is not needed.\nresize_image(..., width=100, op=\"fit_width\")\n\n\n🔗\"fit_height\"\nResizes the image such that the resulting height is height and width is whatever will preserve the aspect ratio.\nThe width argument is not needed.\nresize_image(..., height=150, op=\"fit_height\")\n\n\n🔗\"fit\"\nLike \"fit_width\" and \"fit_height\" combined, but only resize if the image is bigger than any of the specified dimensions.\nThis mode is handy, if for example images are automatically shrunk to certain sizes in a shortcode for\nmobile optimization.\nResizes the image such that the result fits within width and height while preserving the aspect ratio. This\nmeans that both width or height will be at max width and height, respectively, but possibly one of them\nsmaller so as to preserve the aspect ratio.\nresize_image(..., width=5000, height=5000, op=\"fit\")\n\n\nresize_image(..., width=150, height=150, op=\"fit\")\n\n\n🔗\"fill\"\nThis is the default operation. It takes the image's center part with the same aspect ratio as the width and\nheight given and resizes that to width and height. This means that parts of the image that are outside\nof the resized aspect ratio are cropped away.\nresize_image(..., width=150, height=150, op=\"fill\")\n\n\n🔗Using resize_image in markdown via shortcodes\nresize_image is a Zola built-in Tera function (see the templates chapter),\nbut it can be used in Markdown using shortcodes.\nThe examples above were generated using a shortcode file named resize_image.html with this content:\n\n🔗Creating picture galleries\nThe resize_image() can be used multiple times and/or in loops. It is designed to handle this efficiently.\nThis can be used along with assets page metadata to create picture galleries.\nThe assets variable holds paths to all assets in the directory of a page with resources\n(see asset colocation); if you have files other than images you\nwill need to filter them out in the loop first like in the example below.\nThis can be used in shortcodes. For example, we can create a very simple html-only clickable\npicture gallery with the following shortcode named gallery.html:\n\nAs you can notice, we didn't specify an op argument, which means that it'll default to \"fill\". Similarly,\nthe format will default to \"auto\" (choosing PNG or JPEG as appropriate) and the JPEG quality will default to 75.\nTo call it from a Markdown file, simply do:\n\nHere is the result:\n\n\n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n  Image attribution: Public domain, except: _06-example.jpg_: Willi Heidelbach, _07-example.jpg_: Daniel Ullrich.\n\n🔗Get image size and relative resizing\nSometimes when building a gallery it is useful to know the dimensions of each asset.  You can get this information with\nget_image_metadata.\nThis can also be useful in combination with resize_image() to do a relative resizing. So we can create a relative image resizing function with the following shortcode named resize_image_relative.html:\n\nIt can be invoked from Markdown like this:\nresize_image_relative(..., scale=0.5)\n\n\n🔗Creating scaled-down versions of high-resolution images\nWith the above, we can also create a shortcode that creates a 50% scaled-down version of a high-resolution image (e.g. screenshots taken on Retina Macs), along with the proper HTML5 srcset for the original image to be displayed on high-resolution / retina displays.\nConsider the following shortcode named high_res_image.html:\n\n\n\n\n\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/image-processing/","title":"Image processing"},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/linking/":{"body":"🔗Heading id and anchor insertion\nWhile rendering the Markdown content, a unique id will automatically be assigned to each heading.\nThis id is created by converting the heading text to a slug if slugify.anchors is set to \"on\" (the default).\nIf slugify.paths is set to \"safe\", whitespaces are replaced by - and the following characters are stripped: #, %, &lt;, &gt;, [, ], (, ), `, ^, {, |, }.\nIf slugify.paths is set to \"off\", no modifications are made, and you may be left with nominally illegal ids.\nA number is appended at the end if the slug already exists for that article.\nFor example:\n\nYou can also manually specify an id with a {#…} suffix on the heading line as well as CSS classes:\n\nThis is useful for making deep links robust, either proactively (so that you can later change the text of a heading\nwithout breaking links to it) or retroactively (keeping the slug of the old header text when changing the text). It\ncan also be useful for migration of existing sites with different header id schemes, so that you can keep deep\nlinks working.\n🔗Anchor insertion\nIt is possible to have Zola automatically insert anchor links next to the heading, as you can see on this documentation\nif you hover a title or covering the full heading text.\nThis option is set in the global config.toml's [markdown] section and can be overridden at the section level with the insert_anchor_links variable on the\nsection front matter page.\nThe default template is very basic and will need CSS tweaks in your project to look decent.\nIf you want to change the anchor template, it can be easily overwritten by\ncreating an anchor-link.html file in the templates directory. Here you can find the default template.\nThe anchor link template has the following variables:\n\nid: the heading's id after applying the rules defined by slugify.anchors\nlang: the current language, unless called from the markdown template filter, in which case it will always be en\nlevel: the heading level (between 1 and 6)\n\nIf you use insert_anchor_links = \"heading\", the template will still be used but only the opening &lt;a&gt; tag will get extracted\nfrom it, everything else will not be used.\n🔗Internal links\nLinking to other pages and their headings is so common that Zola adds a\nspecial syntax to Markdown links to handle them: start the link with @/ and point to the .md file you want\nto link to. The path to the file starts from the content directory.\nFor example, linking to a file located at content/pages/about.md would be [my link](@/pages/about.md).\nYou can still link to an anchor directly; [my link](@/pages/about.md#example) will work as expected.\nBy default, broken internal links are treated as errors.  To treat them as warnings instead, visit the [link_checker] section of config.toml and set internal_level = \"warn\".  Note: treating broken links as warnings allows the site to be built with broken links intact, so a link such as [my link](@/pages/whoops.md) will be rendered to HTML as &lt;a href=\"@/pages/whoops.md\"&gt;.\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/linking/","title":"Internal links & deep linking"},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/multilingual/":{"body":"Zola supports having a site in multiple languages.\n🔗Configuration\nTo get started, you will need to add the languages you want to support\nto your config.toml. For example:\n\nNote: By default, Chinese and Japanese search indexing is not included. You can include\nthe support by building zola using cargo build --features indexing-ja --features indexing-zh.\nPlease also note that, enabling Chinese indexing will increase the binary size by approximately\n5 MB while enabling Japanese indexing will increase the binary size by approximately 70 MB\ndue to the incredibly large dictionaries.\n🔗Content\nOnce the languages have been added, you can start to translate your content. Zola\nuses the filename to detect the language:\n\ncontent/an-article.md: this will be the default language\ncontent/an-article.fr.md: this will be in French\n\nIf the language code in the filename does not correspond to one of the languages or\nthe default language configured, an error will be shown.\nIf your default language has an _index.md in a directory, you will need to add an _index.{code}.md\nfile with the desired front-matter options as there is no language fallback.\n🔗Output\nZola outputs the translated content with a base URL of {base_url}/{code}/.\nThe only exception to this is if you are setting a translated page path directly in the front matter.\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/multilingual/","title":"Multilingual sites"},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/overview/":{"body":"Zola uses the directory structure to determine the site structure.\nEach child directory in the content directory represents a section\nthat contains pages (your .md files).\n\nEach page path (the part after base_url, for example blog/cli-usage/) can be customised by changing the path or\nslug attribute of the page front-matter.\nYou might have noticed a file named _index.md in the example above.\nThis file is used to store both the metadata and content of the section itself and is not considered a page.\nTo ensure that the terminology used in the rest of the documentation is understood, let's go over the example above.\nThe content directory in this case has three sections: content, blog and landing. The content section has only\none page (something.md), the landing section has no pages and the blog section has 4 pages (cli-usage.md,\nconfiguration.md, directory-structure.md and installation.md).\nSections can be nested indefinitely.\n🔗Asset colocation\nThe content directory is not limited to markup files. It's natural to want to co-locate a page and some related\nassets, such as images or spreadsheets. Zola supports this pattern out of the box for both sections and pages.\nAll non-Markdown files you add in a page/section directory will be copied alongside the generated page when the site is\nbuilt, which allows us to use a relative path to access them.\nPages with co-located assets should not be placed directly in their section directory (such as latest-experiment.md), but\nas an index.md file in a dedicated directory (latest-experiment/index.md), like so:\n\nWith this setup, you may access research.jpg from your 'research' section\nand javascript.js from your 'latest-experiment' page directly within the Markdown:\n\nBy default, this page's slug will be the directory name and thus its permalink will be https://example.com/research/latest-experiment/.\n🔗Excluding files from assets\nIt is possible to ignore selected asset files using the\nignored_content setting in the config file.\nFor example, say that you have several code files which you are linking to on your website.\nFor maintainability, you want to keep your code in the same directory as the Markdown file,\nbut you don't want to copy the build folders to the public web site. You can achieve this by setting ignored_content in the config file:\n(Note of caution: {Cargo.lock,target} is not the same as {Cargo.lock, target})\n\n🔗Static assets\nIn addition to placing content files in the content directory, you may also place content\nfiles in the static directory.  Any files/directories that you place in the static directory\nwill be copied, without modification, to the public directory.\nTypically, you might put site-wide assets (such as a CSS file, the site favicon, site logos or site-wide\nJavaScript) in the root of the static directory. You can also place any HTML or other files that\nyou wish to be included without modification (that is, without being parsed as Markdown files)\ninto the static directory.\nNote that the static directory provides an alternative to co-location.  For example, imagine that you\nhad the following directory structure (a simplified version of the structure presented above):\n\nTo add an image to the https://mywebsite.com/blog/configuration page, you have three options:\n\nYou could save the image to the content/blog/configuration directory and then link to it with a\nrelative path from the index.md page.  This is the approach described under co-location\nabove.\nYou could save the image to a static/blog/configuration directory and link to it in exactly the\nsame way as if you had co-located it. If you do this, the generated files will be identical to those\nobtained if you had co-located the image; the only difference will be that all static files will be saved in the\nstatic directory rather than in the content directory. The choice depends on your organizational needs.\nOr you could save the image to some arbitrary directory within the static directory. For example,\nyou could save all images to static/images.  Using this approach, you can no longer use relative links. Instead,\nyou must use an absolute link to images/[filename] to access your\nimage. This might be preferable for small sites or for sites that associate images with\nmultiple pages (e.g., logo images that appear on every page).\n\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/overview/","title":"Overview"},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/page/":{"body":"A page is any file ending with .md in the content directory, except files\nnamed _index.md. Note: page file names must not contain _index. at all.\nIf a file ending with .md is named index.md, it will generate a page\nwith the name of its directory (for example, /content/about/index.md would\ncreate a page at [base_url]/about). (Note the lack of an underscore; if the file\nwere named _index.md, then it would create a section at [base_url]/about, as\ndiscussed in a previous part of this documentation. In contrast, naming the file index.md will\ncreate a page at [base_url]/about).\nIf the file is given any name other than index.md or _index.md, then it will\ncreate a page with that name (without the .md). For example, naming a file in the root of your\ncontent directory about.md would create a page at [base_url]/about.\nAnother exception to this rule is that a filename starting with a datetime (YYYY-mm-dd or an RFC3339 datetime)\nwill use that date as the page date, unless already set\nin the front matter. A datetime filename can optionally be followed by an underscore (_) or a dash (-), and slug.\nThe page name will be either the datetime or anything after _/-,\nso the file 2018-10-10.md will be available at [base_url]/2018-10-10, and 2018-10-10-hello-world.md will\nbe available at [base_url]/hello-world. Note that the full RFC3339 datetime contains colons, which is not a valid\ncharacter in a filename on Windows.\nThis behavior can be disabled by setting slugify.paths_keep_dates to true (the default is false). Note that a _ separating the date would be slugified into a - with the default value for slugify.paths of \"on\".\nAs you can see, creating an about.md file is equivalent to creating an\nabout/index.md file. The only difference between the two methods is that creating\nthe about directory allows you to use asset co-location, as discussed in the\noverview section.\n🔗Output paths\nFor any page within your content folder, its output path will be defined by either:\n\nits slug frontmatter key\nits filename\n\nEither way, these proposed path will be sanitized before being used.\nIf slugify.paths is set to \"on\" in the site's config - the default - paths are slugified.\nIf it is set to \"safe\", only sanitation is performed, with the following characters being removed: &lt;, &gt;, :, /, |, ?, *, #, \\\\, (, ), [, ] as well as newlines and tabulations. This ensures that the path can be represented on all operating systems.\nAdditionally, trailing whitespace and dots are removed and whitespaces are replaced by _.\nIf slugify.paths is set to \"off\", no modifications are made.\nIf you want URLs containing non-ASCII characters, slugify.paths needs to be set to \"safe\" or \"off\".\n🔗Path from frontmatter\nThe output path for the page will first be read from the slug key in the page's frontmatter.\nExample: (file content/zines/élevage-chèvre.md)\n\nThis frontmatter will output the article to [base_url]/zines/élevage-chèvre-carrière-alternative with slugify.paths set to \"safe\" or \"off\", and to [base_url]/zines/elevage-chevre-carriere-alternative with the default value for slugify.paths of \"on\".\n🔗Path from filename\nWhen the article's output path is not specified in the frontmatter, it is extracted from the file's path in the content folder. Consider a file content/foo/bar/thing.md. The output path is constructed:\n\nif the filename is index.md, its parent folder name (bar) is used as output path\notherwise, the output path is extracted from thing&nbsp;(the filename without the .md extension)\n\nIf the path found starts with a datetime string (YYYY-mm-dd or a RFC3339 datetime) followed by optional whitespace and then an underscore (_) or a dash (-), this date is removed from the output path and will be used as the page date (unless already set in the front-matter). Note that the full RFC3339 datetime contains colons, which is not a valid character in a filename on Windows.\nThe output path extracted from the file path is then slugified or not, depending on the slugify.paths config, as explained previously.\nExample:\nThe file content/blog/2018-10-10-hello-world.md will yield a page at [base_url]/blog/hello-world. With optional whitespace, the file content/blog/2021-01-23 -hello new world.md will yield a page at [base_url]/blog/hello-new-world\n🔗Front matter\nThe TOML front matter is a set of metadata embedded in a file at the beginning of the file enclosed\nby triple pluses (+++).\nAlthough none of the front matter variables are mandatory, the opening and closing +++ are required.\nNote that even though the use of TOML is encouraged, YAML front matter is also supported to ease porting\nlegacy content. In this case the embedded metadata must be enclosed by triple minuses (---).\nHere is an example page with all the available variables. The values provided below are the\ndefault values.\n\n🔗Summary\nYou can ask Zola to create a summary if, for example, you only want to show the first\nparagraph of the page content in a list.\nTo do so, add &lt;!-- more --&gt; in your content at the point\nwhere you want the summary to end. The content up to that point will be\navailable separately in the\ntemplate via page.summary.\nA span element in this position with a continue-reading id is created, so you can link directly to it if needed. For example:\n&lt;a href=\"{{ page.permalink }}#continue-reading\"&gt;Continue Reading&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;!-- more --&gt; marker can also exist in the middle of a line, and it will ensure that this does not emit unclosed HTML tags.\nYou can use the summary-cutoff.html to show text after the summary (but before these closing tags) based\nupon the summary before the cutoff.\nBy default, it will show an ellipsis (…) regardless of the content of the summary, but you can use a different template if you want to only show an ellipsis if the summary does not end in any punctuation:\n\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/page/","title":"Page"},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/sass/":{"body":"Sass is a popular CSS preprocessor that adds special features (e.g., variables, nested rules) to facilitate the\nmaintenance of large sets of CSS rules.

Consider a very simple\nexample: a blog directory with three files: blog/Post_1.md,\nblog/Post_2.md and blog/Post_3.md.  To iterate over these posts and\ncreate a list of links to the posts, a simple template might look like this:\n\nThis would iterate over the posts in the order specified\nby the sort_by variable set in the _index.md page for the corresponding\nsection.  The sort_by variable can be given a few values: date, update_date\ntitle, title_bytes, weight, slug, permalink or none.  If sort_by\nis not set, the pages will be sorted in the none order, which is not intended\nfor sorted content.\nAny page that is missing the data it needs to be sorted will be ignored and\nwon't be rendered. For example, if a page is missing the date variable and its\nsection sets sort_by = \"date\", then that page will be ignored.\nThe terminal will warn you if this occurs.\nIf several pages have the same date/weight/order, their permalink will be used\nto break the tie based on alphabetical order.\n🔗Sorting pages\nThe sort_by front-matter variable can have the following values:\n🔗date\nThis will sort all pages by their date field, from the most recent (at the\ntop of the list) to the oldest (at the bottom of the list). Each page will\nget page.lower and page.higher variables that contain the pages with\nearlier and later dates, respectively.\n🔗update_date\nSame as date except it will take into account any updated date for the pages.\n🔗title\nThis will sort all pages by their title field in natural lexical order, as\ndefined  by natural_lexical_cmp in the lexical-sort crate. Each page will\nget page.lower and page.higher variables that contain the pages\nwith  previous and next titles, respectively.\nFor example, here is a natural lexical ordering: \"bachata, BART, bolero,\nμ-kernel, meter, Métro, Track-2, Track-3, Track-13, underground\". Notice how\nspecial characters and numbers are sorted reasonably.\n🔗title_bytes\nSame as title except it uses the bytes directly to sort.\nNatural sorting treats non-ascii\ncharacters like their closest ascii character. This can lead to unexpected\nresults for languages with different character sets. The last three characters\nof the Swedish alphabet, åäö, for example would be considered by the natural\nsort as aao. In that case the standard byte-order sort may be more suitable.\n🔗weight\nThis will sort all pages by their weight field, from the lightest weight\n(at the top of the list) to the heaviest (at the bottom of the list). Each\npage gets page.lower and page.higher variables that contain the\npages with lighter and heavier weights, respectively.\n🔗slug\nThis will sort pages or sections by their slug in natural lexical order.\n🔗permalink\nSimilar to slug, this will sort pages or sections by their permalink in natural lexical order.\nUseful if you set the path key on your pages.\n🔗Reversed sorting\nWhen iterating through pages, you may wish to use the Tera reverse filter,\nwhich reverses the order of the pages.  For example, after using the reverse filter,\npages sorted by weight will be sorted from lightest (at the top) to heaviest\n(at the bottom); pages sorted by date will be sorted from oldest (at the top)\nto newest (at the bottom).\nreverse has no effect on page.lower / page.higher.\nIf the section is paginated the paginate_reversed=true in the front matter of the relevant section should be set instead of using the filter.\n🔗Sorting subsections\nSorting sections is a bit less flexible: sections can only be sorted by weight,\nand do not have variables that point to the heavier/lighter sections.\nBy default, the lightest (lowest weight) subsections will be at\nthe top of the list and the heaviest (highest weight) will be at the bottom;\nthe reverse filter reverses this order.\nNote: Unlike pages, permalinks will not be used to break ties between\nequally weighted sections. Thus, if the weight variable for your section is not set (or if it\nis set in a way that produces ties), then your sections will be sorted in\nrandom order. Moreover, that order is determined at build time and will\nchange with each site rebuild.  Thus, if there is any chance that you will\niterate over your sections, you should always assign them distinct weights.\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/section/","title":"Section"},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/shortcodes/":{"body":"Zola borrows the concept of shortcodes from WordPress.\nIn our case, a shortcode corresponds to a template defined in the templates/shortcodes directory that can be used in a Markdown file.\nBroadly speaking, Zola's shortcodes cover two distinct use cases:\n\nInject more complex HTML: Markdown is good for writing, but it isn't great when you need to add inline HTML or styling.\nEase repetitive data based tasks: when you have external data that you\nwant to display in your page's body.\n\nThe latter may also be solved by writing HTML, however Zola allows the use of Markdown based shortcodes which end in .md\nrather than .html. This may be particularly useful if you want to include headings generated by the shortcode in the\ntable of contents.\nIf you want to use something similar to shortcodes in your templates, you can use Tera macros. They are functions or components that you can call to return some text.\n🔗Writing a shortcode\nLet's write a shortcode to embed YouTube videos as an example.\nIn a file called youtube.html in the templates/shortcodes directory, paste the\nfollowing:\n\nThis template is very straightforward: an iframe pointing to the YouTube embed URL wrapped in a &lt;div&gt;.\nIn terms of input, this shortcode expects at least one variable: id (example here).\nBecause the other variables are in an if statement, they are optional.\nThat's it. Zola will now recognise this template as a shortcode named youtube (the filename minus the .html extension).\nThe Markdown renderer will wrap an inline HTML node such as &lt;a&gt; or &lt;span&gt; into a paragraph.\nIf you want to disable this behaviour, wrap your shortcode in a &lt;div&gt;.\nA Markdown based shortcode in turn will be treated as if what it returned was part of the page's body. If we create\nbooks.md in templates/shortcodes for example:\n\nThis will create a shortcode books with the argument path pointing to a .toml file where it loads lists of books with\ntitles and descriptions. They will flow with the rest of the document in which books is called.\nShortcodes are rendered before the page's Markdown is parsed so they don't have access to the page's table of contents.\nBecause of that, you also cannot use the get_page / get_section / get_taxonomy / get_taxonomy_term global functions. It might work while\nrunning zola serve because it has been loaded but it will fail during zola build.\n🔗Using shortcodes\nThere are two kinds of shortcodes:\n\nones that do not take a body, such as the YouTube example above\nones that do, such as one that styles a quote\n\nIn both cases, the arguments must be named and they will all be passed to the template.\nParentheses are mandatory even if there are no arguments.\nNote that while shortcodes look like normal Tera expressions, they are not Tera at all -- they can\npretty much just shuttle arguments to their template. Several limitations of note are:\n\nAll arguments are required\nThe shortcode cannot reference Tera variables\nConcatenation and other operators are unavailable\n\nIf the shortcode is invalid, it will not be interpreted by the markdown parser and will instead\nget rendered directly into the final HTML.\nLastly, a shortcode name (and thus the corresponding .html file) as well as any argument names\ncan only contain numbers, letters and underscores, and must start with a letter or underscore.\nIn Regex terms, ^[A-Za-z_][0-9A-Za-z_]+$.\nArgument values can be of one of five types:\n\nstring: surrounded by double quotes, single quotes or backticks\nbool: true or false\nfloat: a number with a decimal point (e.g., 1.2)\ninteger: a whole number or its negative counterpart (e.g., 3)\narray: an array of any kind of value, except arrays\n\nMalformed values will be silently ignored.\nBoth types of shortcode will also get either a page or section variable depending on where they were used\nand a config variable. These values will overwrite any arguments passed to a shortcode so these variable names\nshould not be used as argument names in shortcodes.\n🔗Shortcodes without body\nSimply call the shortcode as if it was a Tera function in a variable block.\n\nNote that if you want to have some content that looks like a shortcode but not have Zola try to render it,\nyou will need to escape it by using {{/* and */}} instead of {{ and }}.\n🔗Shortcodes with body\nLet's imagine that we have the following shortcode quote.html template:\n\nWe could use it in our Markdown file like so:\n\nThe body of the shortcode will be automatically passed down to the rendering context as the body variable and needs\nto be on a new line.\n🔗Shortcodes with no arguments\nNote that for both cases that the parentheses for shortcodes are necessary.\nA shortcode without the parentheses will render as plaintext and no warning will be emitted.\nAs an example, this is how an aside shortcode-with-body with no arguments would be defined in aside.html:\n\nWe could use it in our Markdown file like so:\n\n🔗Content similar to shortcodes\nIf you want to have some content that looks like a shortcode but not have Zola try to render it,\nyou will need to escape it by using {%/* and */%} instead of {% and %}. You won't need to escape\nanything else until the closing tag.\n🔗Shortcode context\nEvery shortcode can access some variables, beyond what you explicitly passed as parameter. These variables are explained in the following subsections:\n\ninvocation count (nth)\ncurrent language (lang), unless called from the markdown template filter (in which case it will always be the same value as default_language in configuration, or en when it is unset)\ncolocated_path\n\nWhen one of these variables conflict with a variable passed as argument, the argument value will be used.\n🔗nth: invocation count\nEvery shortcode context is passed in a variable named nth that tracks how many times a particular shortcode has\nbeen invoked in the current Markdown file. Given a shortcode true_statement.html template:\n\nIt could be used in our Markdown as follows:\n\nThis is useful when implementing custom markup for features such as sidenotes or end notes.\n🔗lang: current language\nNOTE: When calling a shortcode from within the markdown template filter, the lang variable will always be en.\nIf you feel like you need that, please consider using template macros instead.\nIf you really need that, you can rewrite your Markdown content to pass lang as argument to the shortcode.\nEvery shortcode can access the current language in the lang variable in the context.\nThis is useful for presenting/filtering information in a shortcode depending in a per-language manner. For example, to display a per-language book cover for the current page in a shortcode called bookcover.md:\n\n🔗page or section\nYou can access a slightly stripped down version of the equivalent variables in the normal templates.\nThe following attributes will be empty:\n\ntranslations\nbacklinks\npages\n\n(Note: this is because the rendering of markdown is done before populating the sections)\nA useful attribute to page in shortcodes is colocated_path.\nThis is used when you want to pass the name of some assets to shortcodes without repeating the full folders path.\nMostly useful when combined with load_data or resize_image.\n\n🔗Examples\nHere are some shortcodes for inspiration.\n🔗YouTube\nEmbed a responsive player for a YouTube video.\nThe arguments are:\n\nid: the video id (mandatory)\nplaylist: the playlist id (optional)\nclass: a class to add to the &lt;div&gt; surrounding the iframe\nautoplay: when set to \"true\", the video autoplays on load\n\nCode:\n\nUsage example:\n\n🔗Image Gallery\nSee content processing page for code and example.\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/shortcodes/","title":"Shortcodes"},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/syntax-highlighting/":{"body":"Zola comes with built-in syntax highlighting but you first\nneed to enable it in the configuration.\nOnce this is done, Zola will automatically highlight all code blocks\nin your content.

In AWS you can not only host the website files, but also buy a domain name and speed up your website via their global CDN (CloudFront).\nFor GitHub Actions to modify the files in your bucket, you need to create an IAM user in your AWS account that has just enough permissions to perform what we need and no more.\nFirst we need to create a new policy by logging on to AWS Console and going to IAM &gt; Policies &gt; Create policy. Switch from the visual editor to JSON and paste the following snippet. Remember to update your bucket name:\n\nThe AccessToCloudfront portion is not required if you're not going to speed up your website with CloudFront.\nOnce the policy is created you need to create a new user under IAM &gt; Users. Give it a name such as github-actions-user. On the Set permissions step select Attach policies directly and find the policy we created in the last step.\nFrom the list of users click on your newly created account and then open the Security Credentials tab. Under Access keys select &gt; Create access key and choose Command Line Interface (CLI). Click \"I understand the above recommendation\" and then Create access key. Note the Access key ID and Secret access key.\n🔗Setup Secrets in GitHub\nThe access keys we just created need to be configured as secrets in your GitHub repo. To do so, navigate to Setting &gt; expand Secrets and variables &gt; click on Actions.\nUnder Repository secrets click Add repository secret. In the Name field enter AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and in the  Secret field enter the value from the previous step. Do the same for the secret access key, naming it AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.

You can do\nthis through Netlify's web GUI or via the command line.\nFor a command-line manual deploy, follow these steps:\n\nGenerate a Personal Access Token from the settings section of your Netlify account (not an OAuth Application).\nBuild your site with zola build.\nCreate a zip folder containing the public directory.\nRun the curl command below, filling in your values for PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_FROM_STEP_1, FILE_NAME.zip\nand SITE_NAME.\n(Optional) delete the zip folder.\n\n\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/netlify/","title":"Netlify"},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/overview/":{"body":"Zola outputs plain files, no databases needed.

If you use a different directory, then\nspecify output directory under the \"Build and Output Settings\" dropdown.\nYou can learn more about how to setup a custom domain and how to get the most out of Vercel\nvia their documentation.\nAfter you click the blue \"Deploy\" button, it's off to the races!\nTo use a specific version of Zola, set ZOLA_VERSION environment variable in project settings to a valid\nrelease tag, for example 0.17.2.\n🔗Troubleshooting\n🔗GLIBC_X.XX not found\nThis is because Vercel's build images doesn't come with a glibc version that Zola requires.\nVercel provides different build images for\ndifferent Node.js versions, so even though Zola has no relation with Node.js at all, you can\nbump your Node.js version from project settings to make Vercel to use a newer build\nenvironment, allowing Zola to work properly.\nIf your project was created before when the default Node.js version was 20.x, bumping\nNode.js version to 22.x (which is the new default) should work for Zola versions up to\n0.19.2 (inclusive) without further configuration.\nSince Vercel does not provide a even newer image, subsequent versions of Zola will not work\nagain when using the built-in Zola framework preset. However, starting with Zola version\n0.21.0, a statically linked musl binary being released, which provides the highest\ncompatibility among systems where glibc is insufficient - like Vercel's build images. To use\nthe musl-compiled binary, you must ensure that Vercel\ndoes not use its built-in Zola preset and instead provide the binary yourself.\n🔗Additional options\n🔗Enable trailing slashes\nVisiting a page without trailing slash may break relative paths, so you might want to configure\nVercel to always redirect paths with a trailing slash. By default, redirecting to a trailing\nslash is not enabled on Vercel.\nFor example if you have an about.md file, and when visiting the path without a trailing\nslash, like /about, Vercel will redirect with trailing slash, resulting in /about/.\nPaths with a file extension will not redirect to a trailing slash, for example if you\nhave a static file named favicon.ico, it will stay as-is.\nTo enable that, create a file in the root of your git repository named vercel.json\n(if it doesn't exists already), and set this option:\n\n🔗Prefer clean URLs\nWhen enabled, all HTML files will be served without their file extension. For example\nif you have an about.md file, Zola will generate a about/index.html file, but you may\nprefer to have Vercel to serve the file as /about without its index.html suffix.\nTo enable that, create a file in the root of your git repository named vercel.json\n(if it doesn't exists already), and set this option:\n\n🔗Using a custom Zola binary\nIf you want to provide Zola binary on your own for full control instead of having Vercel\nto use their controlled Zola preset, set the \"Framework Preset\" to \"Other\". This will make\nVercel to not get use of ZOLA_VERSION variable anymore automatically.\nThen, set \"Install Command\" to:\n\nThis command will download Zola from the file URL obtained from GitHub API and extract it.\nThis way we can continue using same ZOLA_VERSION environment variable name to pin to a\nspecific Zola version (same as how Vercel does) - or set it to latest to always pull the\nlatest version whenever an deployment is initiated on Vercel.\nWe also pull musl binaries by default in the command, so we no longer have to worry\nabout Vercel's build images. But if you would like to use older versions (below of\n0.21.0 where there isn't a musl binary provided), you need to create a new environment\nvariable named ZOLA_LIBC and set it to gnu.\nAlong with setting \"Install Command\" to above, you will also need to set \"Build Command\"\nto ./zola build, so we can have our site built with the locally downloaded Zola binary\npreviously.\nIf you prefer to use vercel.json instead,\n(which overrides the options set in the dashboard) you can use this configuration:\n\nYou can modify the commands as your wish if you would like to use your own fork and use\nbinaries released there.\n🔗See also\nSee Vercel's own documentation\nfor all available options in vercel.json.\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/vercel/","title":"Vercel"},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/zeabur/":{"body":"In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of deploying your Zola site onto the Zeabur.

It is written in Rust and uses the Tera template engine, which is similar to Jinja2, Django templates, Liquid, and Twig.\nContent is written in CommonMark, a strongly defined, highly compatible specification of Markdown. Zola uses pulldown-cmark to parse markdown files. The goal of this library is 100% compliance with the CommonMark spec. It adds a few additional features such as parsing footnotes, Github flavored tables, Github flavored task lists and strikethrough.\nSSGs use dynamic templates to transform content into static HTML pages. Static sites are thus very fast and require no databases, making them easy to host. A comparison between static and dynamic sites, such as WordPress, Drupal, and Django, can be found here.\nTo get a taste of Zola, please see the quick overview below.\n🔗First Steps with Zola\nUnlike some SSGs, Zola makes no assumptions regarding the structure of your site. In this overview, we'll be making a simple blog site.\n🔗Initialize Site\n\nThis overview is based on Zola 0.19.1.\n\nPlease see the detailed installation instructions for your platform. With Zola installed, let's initialize our site:\n\nYou will be asked a few questions.\n\nFor our blog, let's accept the default values (i.e., press Enter for each question). We now have a myblog directory with the following structure:\n\nFor reference, by the end of this overview, our myblog directory will have the following structure:\n\nChange directory into the newly-created myblog directory.\n🔗Templates\nWe'll first create some templates to describe the structure of our site.\n🔗Home Page Template\nLet's make a template for a home page. Create templates/base.html with the following content. This step will make more sense as we move through this overview.\n\nNow, let's create templates/index.html with the following content.\n\nThis tells Zola that index.html extends our base.html file and replaces the block called \"content\" with the text between the {% block content %} and {% endblock content %} tags.\n🔗Blog Template\nTo create a template for a page that lists all blog posts, create templates/blog.html with the following content.\n\nAs done by index.html, blog.html extends base.html, but in this template we want to list the blog posts. Here we also see expressions such as {{ section.[...] }} and {{ page.[...] }} which will be replaced with values from our content when zola combines content with this template to render a page. In the list below the header, we loop through all the pages in our section (blog directory; more on this when we create content) and output each page title and URL using {{ page.title }} and {{ page.permalink | safe }}, respectively. We use the | safe filter because the permalink doesn't need to be HTML escaped (escaping would cause / to render as &amp;#x2F;).\n🔗Blog Post Template\nWe have templates describing our home page and a page that lists all blog posts. Let's now create a template for an individual blog post. Create templates/blog-page.html with the following content.\n\n\nNote the | safe filter for {{ page.content }}.\n\n🔗Zola Live Reloading\nNow that we've outlined our site's structure, let's start the Zola development server in the myblog directory.\n\nIf you point your web browser to http://127.0.0.1:1111, you will see a message saying, \"This is my blog made with Zola.\"\nIf you go to http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/, you will currently get a 404 which we will fix next.\n🔗Content\nWe'll now create some content that Zola will use to generate site pages based on our templates.\n🔗Sections\nWe'll start by creating content/blog/_index.md. This file tells Zola that blog is a section, which is how content is categorized in Zola. In the _index.md file, we'll set the following variables in TOML format:\n\n\nNote that although no variables are mandatory, the opening and closing +++ are required.\n\n\nsort_by = \"date\" tells Zola to use the date to order our section pages (more on pages below).\ntemplate = \"blog.html\" tells Zola to use templates/blog.html as the template for listing the Markdown files in this section.\npage_template = \"blog-page.html\" tells Zola to use templates/blog-page.html as the template for individual Markdown files.\n\nFor a full list of section variables, please see the section documentation.\nThe value of our title variable here is available to templates such as blog.html as {{ section.title }}.\nIf you now go to http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/, you will see an empty list of posts.\n🔗Markdown\nWe'll now create some blog posts. Create content/blog/first.md with the following content.\n\nThe title and date will be available to us in the blog-page.html template as {{ page.title }} and {{ page.date }}, respectively. All text below the closing +++ will be available to templates as {{ page.content }}.\nIf you now go back to our blog list page at http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/, you should see our lonely post. Let's add another. Create content/blog/second.md with the contents:\n\nBack at http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/, our second post shows up on top of the list because it's newer than the first post and we had set sort_by = \"date\" in our _index.md file.\nAs a final step, let's modify templates/index.html (our home page) to link to our list of blog posts:\n\nThis has been a quick overview of Zola.

So it is easier for user to subscribe.\nAs an example this is how it looks like using Firefox Livemarks addon.\n\nYou can enable posts autodiscovery modifying your blog base.html template adding the following code in between the &lt;head&gt; tags.\n\nYou can as well use an Atom feed using type=\"application/atom+xml\" and path=\"atom.xml\".\nAll pages on your site will refer to your post feed.\nIn order to enable the tag feeds as well, you can overload the block rss using the following code in your tags/single.html template.\n\nEach tag page will refer to it's dedicated feed.\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/templates/feeds/","title":"Feeds"},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/templates/overview/":{"body":"Zola uses the Tera template engine, which is very similar\nto Jinja2, Liquid and Twig.\nAs this documentation will only talk about how templates work in Zola, please read\nthe Tera template documentation if you want\nto learn more about it first.\nAll templates live in the templates directory.  If you are not sure what variables are available in a template,\nyou can place {{ __tera_context }} in the template to print the whole context.\nA few variables are available on all templates except feeds and the sitemap:\n\nconfig: the language aware configuration\ncurrent_path: the path (full URL without base_url) of the current page, always starting with a /\ncurrent_url: the full URL for the current page\nlang: the language for the current page\n\nConfig variables can be accessed like config.variable, in HTML for example with {{ config.base_url }}.\nThe 404 template does not get current_path and current_url (this information cannot be determined).\nOn top of the config attributes mentioned above, it also gets config.mode which is whether it's run in build, serve or check.\n🔗Standard templates\nBy default, Zola will look for three templates: index.html, which is applied\nto the site homepage; section.html, which is applied to all sections (any HTML\npage generated by creating a directory within your content directory); and\npage.html, which is applied to all pages (any HTML page generated by creating an\n.md file within your content directory).\nThe homepage is always a section (regardless of whether it contains other pages).\nThus, the index.html and section.html templates both have access to the\nsection variables.  The page.html template has access to the page variables.\nThe page and section variables are described in more detail in the next section.\n🔗Built-in templates\nZola comes with four built-in templates: atom.xml and rss.xml (described in\nFeeds), sitemap.xml (described in Sitemap),\nand robots.txt (described in Robots.txt).\nAdditionally, themes can add their own templates, which will be applied if not\noverridden.  You can override built-in or theme templates by creating a template with\nthe same name in the correct path. For example, you can override the Atom template by\ncreating a templates/atom.xml file.\n🔗Custom templates\nIn addition to the standard index.html, section.html and page.html templates,\nyou may also create custom templates by creating an .html file in the templates\ndirectory.  These custom templates will not be used by default.  Instead, a custom template will only be used if you apply it by setting the template front-matter variable to the path for that template (or if you include it in another template that is applied).  For example, if you created a custom template for your site's About page called about.html, you could apply it to your about.md page by including the following front matter in your about.md page:\n\nCustom templates are not required to live at the root of your templates directory.\nFor example, product_pages/with_pictures.html is a valid template.\n🔗Built-in filters\nZola adds a few filters in addition to those already present\nin Tera.\n🔗markdown\nConverts the given variable to HTML using Markdown. There are a few differences compared to page/section Markdown rendering:\n\nshortcodes evaluated by this filter cannot access the current rendering context: config will be available, but accessing section or page (among others) from a shortcode called within the markdown filter will prevent your site from building (see this discussion)\nlang in shortcodes will always be equal to the site's config.default_language (or en otherwise) ; it should not be a problem, but if it is in most cases, but if you need to use language-aware shortcodes in this filter, please refer to the Shortcode context section of the docs.\n\nBy default, the filter will wrap all text in a paragraph. To disable this behaviour, you can\npass true to the inline argument:\n\nYou do not need to use this filter with page.content or section.content, the content is already rendered.\n🔗base64_encode\nEncode the variable to base64.\n🔗base64_decode\nDecode the variable from base64.\n🔗regex_replace\nReplace text via regular expressions.\n\n🔗num_format\nFormat a number into its string representation.\n\nBy default this will format the number using the locale set by config.default_language in config.toml.\nTo format a number for a specific locale, you can use the locale argument and pass the name of the desired locale:\n\n🔗Built-in functions\nZola adds a few Tera functions to those built-in in Tera\nto make it easier to develop complex sites.\n🔗File searching logic\nFor functions that are searching for a file on disk other than through get_page and get_section, the following\nlogic applies.\n\nThe base directory is the Zola root directory, where the config.toml is\nFor the given path: if it starts with @/, replace that with content/ instead and trim any leading /\nSearch in the following locations in this order, returning the first where the file exists:\n\n$base_directory + $path\n$base_directory + \"static/\" + $path\n$base_directory + \"content/\" + $path\n$base_directory + $output_path + $path\n$base_directory + \"themes\" + $theme + \"static/\" + $path (only if using a theme)\n\n\n\nIn practice this means that @/some/image.jpg, /content/some/image.jpg and content/some/image.jpg will point to the\nsame thing.\nIt will error if the path is outside the Zola directory.\n🔗get_page\nTakes a path to an .md file and returns the associated page. The base path is the content directory.\n\nIf selecting a specific language for the page, you can pass lang with the language code to the function:\n\n🔗get_section\nTakes a path to an _index.md file and returns the associated section. The base path is the content directory.\n\nIf you only need the metadata of the section, you can pass metadata_only=true to the function:\n\nIf selecting a specific language for the section, you can pass lang with the language code to the function:\n\n🔗get_taxonomy_url\nGets the permalink for the taxonomy item found.\n\nname will almost always come from a variable but in case you want to do it manually,\nthe value should be the same as the one in the front matter, not the slugified version.\nlang (optional) default to config.default_language in config.toml\nrequired (optional) if a taxonomy is defined but there isn't any content that uses it then throw an error. Defaults to true.\n🔗get_taxonomy\nGets the whole taxonomy of a specific kind.\n\nThe type of the output is:\n\nlang (optional) default to config.default_language in config.toml\nrequired (optional) if a taxonomy is defined but there isn't any content that uses it then throw an error. Defaults to true.\nSee the Taxonomies documentation for a full documentation of those types.\n🔗get_taxonomy_term\nGets a single term from a taxonomy of a specific kind.\n\nThe type of the output is a single TaxonomyTerm item.\nlang (optional) default to config.default_language in config.toml\ninclude_pages (optional) default to true. If false, the pages item in the TaxonomyTerm will be empty, regardless of what pages may actually exist for this term. page_count will correctly reflect the number of pages for this term in both cases.\nrequired (optional) if a taxonomy or term is not found`.\nSee the Taxonomies documentation for a full documentation of those types.\n🔗get_url\nGets the permalink for the given path.\nIf the path starts with @/, it will be treated as an internal link to a Markdown file,\nstarting from the root content directory as well as validated.\n\nIt accepts an optional parameter lang in order to compute a language-aware URL in multilingual websites. Assuming config.base_url is \"http://example.com\", the following snippet will:\n\nreturn \"http://example.com/blog/\" if config.default_language is \"en\"\nreturn \"http://example.com/en/blog/\" if config.default_language is not \"en\" and \"en\" appears in config.languages\nfail otherwise, with the error message \"'en' is not an authorized language (check config.languages).\"\n\n\nThis can also be used to get the permalink for a static file, for example if\nyou want to link to the file that is located at static/css/app.css:\n\nBy default, the link will not have a trailing slash. You can force one by passing trailing_slash=true to the get_url function.\nAn example is:\n\nIn the case of a non-internal link, you can also add a cachebust of the format ?h=&lt;sha256&gt; at the end of a URL\nby passing cachebust=true to the get_url function. In this case, the path will need to resolve to an actual file.\nSee File Searching Logic for details.\n🔗get_hash\nReturns the hash digest (SHA-256, SHA-384 or SHA-512) of a file or a string literal.\nIt can take the following arguments:\n\npath: mandatory, see File Searching Logic for details\nor literal: mandatory, the string value to be hashed\nsha_type: optional, one of 256, 384 or 512, defaults to 384\nbase64: optional, true or false, defaults to true. Whether to encode the hash as base64\n\nEither path or literal must be given.\n\nThe function can also output a base64-encoded hash value when its base64\nparameter is set to true. This can be used to implement subresource\nintegrity.\n\nDo note that subresource integrity is typically used when using external scripts, which get_hash does not support.\n🔗get_image_metadata\nGets metadata for an image. This supports common formats like JPEG, PNG, WebP, BMP, GIF as well as SVG.\nIt can take the following arguments:\n\npath: mandatory, see File Searching Logic for details\nallow_missing: optional, true or false, defaults to false. Whether a missing file should raise an error or not.\n\nThe method returns a map containing width, height, format, and mime. The format returned is the most common file extension for the file format, which may not match the one used for the image.\n\n🔗load_data\nLoads data from a file, URL, or string literal. Supported file types include toml, json, csv, bibtex, yaml/yml,\nand xml and only supports UTF-8 encoding.\nAny other file type will be loaded as plain text.\nThe path argument specifies the path to a local data file, according to the File Searching Logic.\n\nAlternatively, the url argument specifies the location of a remote URL to load.\n\nAlternatively, the literal argument specifies an object literal. Note: if the format argument is not specified, then plain text will be what is assumed.\n\nNote: the required parameter has no effect when used in combination with the literal argument.\nThe optional required boolean argument can be set to false so that missing data (HTTP error or local file not found) does not produce an error, but returns a null value instead. However, permission issues with a local file and invalid data that could not be parsed to the requested data format will still produce an error even with required=false.\nThe snippet below outputs the HTML from a Wikipedia page, or \"No data found\" if the page was not reachable, or did not return a successful HTTP code:\n\nThe optional format argument allows you to specify and override which data type is contained within the specified file or URL.\nValid entries are toml, json, csv, bibtex, yaml, xml or plain. If the format argument isn't specified, then the\npath extension is used. In the case of a literal, plain is assumed if format is unspecified.\n\nUse the plain format for when your file has a supported extension but you want to load it as plain text.\nFor toml, json, yaml and xml, the data is loaded into a structure matching the original data file;\nhowever, for csv there is no native notion of such a structure. Instead, the data is separated\ninto a data structure containing headers and records. See the example below to see\nhow this works.\nIn the template:\n\nIn the content/blog/story/data.csv file:\n\nThe equivalent json value of the parsed data would be stored in the data variable in the\ntemplate:\n\nThe bibtex format loads data into a structure matching the format used by the\nnom-bibtex crate. The following is an example of data\nin bibtex format:\n\nThe following is the json-equivalent format of the produced bibtex data structure:\n\nFinally, the bibtex data can be accessed from the template as follows:\n\n🔗Remote content\nInstead of using a file, you can load data from a remote URL. This can be done by specifying a url parameter\nto load_data rather than path.\n\nBy default, the response body will be returned with no parsing. This can be changed by using the format argument\nas below.\n\nWhen no other parameters are specified the URL will always be retrieved using a HTTP GET request.\nUsing the parameter method, since version 0.14.0, you can also choose to retrieve the URL using a POST request.\nWhen using method=\"POST\" you can also use the parameters body and content_type.\nThe parameter body is the actual contents sent in the POST request.\nThe parameter content_type should be the mimetype of the body.\nThis example will make a POST request to the kroki service to generate a SVG.\n\nIf you need additional handling for the HTTP headers, you can use the headers parameter.\nYou might need this parameter when the resource requires authentication or require passing additional\nparameters via special headers.\nPlease note that the headers will be appended to the default headers set by Zola itself instead of replacing them.\nThis example will make a POST request to the GitHub markdown rendering service.\n\nThe following example shows how to send a GraphQL query to GitHub (requires authentication).\nIf you want to try this example on your own machine, you need to provide a GitHub PAT (Personal Access Token),\nyou can acquire the access token at this link: https://github.com/settings/tokens and then set GITHUB_TOKEN\nenvironment variable to the access token you have obtained.\n\nIn case you need to specify multiple headers with the same name, you can specify them like this:\n\nWhich is equivalent to two Accept headers with application/json and text/html.\nIf it doesn't work, you can instead specify the headers multiple times to achieve a similar effect:\n\n🔗Data caching\nData file loading and remote requests are cached in memory during the build, so multiple requests aren't made\nto the same endpoint.\nURLs are cached based on the URL, and data files are cached based on the file modified time.\nThe format is also taken into account when caching, so a request will be sent twice if it's loaded with two\ndifferent formats.\n🔗trans\nGets the translation of the given key, for the default_language, the language given or the active language:\n\n🔗resize_image\nResizes an image file.\nPlease refer to Content / Image Processing for complete documentation.\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/templates/overview/","title":"Overview"},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/templates/pages-sections/":{"body":"Templates for pages and sections are very similar.\n🔗Page variables\nZola will try to load the templates/page.html template, the page.html template of the theme if one is used\nor render the built-in template (a blank page).\nWhichever template you decide to render, you will get a page variable in your template\nwith the following fields:\n\n🔗Section variables\nBy default, Zola will try to load templates/index.html for content/_index.md\nand templates/section.html for other _index.md files.

For any given theme template, you can either override a single block in it, or replace the whole template. If a site template and a theme template collide, the site template will be given priority. Whether a theme template collides or not, theme templates remain accessible from any template within theme_name/templates/.\n🔗Replacing a template\nWhen your site uses a theme, the generated structure follows the theme's structure whenever possible, i.e. there are no user defined templates with the same name and relative path as the theme's; for example: with two files templates/page.html and themes/theme_name/templates/page.html, the site template is the one that will be used. Such a conflict results in the theme's template being ignored in favor of the template defined by the user.\n🔗Overriding a block\nIf you don't want to replace a whole template, but override parts of it, you can extend the template and redefine some specific blocks. For example, if you want to override the title block in your theme's page.html, you can create a page.html file in your site templates with the following content:\n\nIf you extend page.html and not theme_name/templates/page.html specifically, it will extend the site's page template if it exists, and the theme's page template otherwise. This makes it possible to override your theme's base template(s) from your site templates, as long as the theme templates do not hardcode the theme name in template paths. For instance, children templates in the theme should use {% extends 'index.html' %}, not {% extends 'theme_name/templates/index.html' %}.\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/extending-a-theme/","title":"Customizing a theme"},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/":{"body":"🔗Installing a theme\nThe easiest way to install a theme is to clone its repository in the themes\ndirectory:\n\nCloning the repository using Git or another VCS will allow you to easily\nupdate. Alternatively, you can download the files manually and place\nthem in a folder.\nYou can find a list of themes here.\n🔗Using a theme\nNow that you have the theme in your themes directory, you need to tell\nZola to use it by setting the theme variable in the\nconfiguration file. The theme\nname has to be the name of the directory you cloned the theme in.\nFor example, if you cloned a theme in themes/simple-blog, the theme name to use\nin the configuration file is simple-blog. Also make sure to place the variable in the top level of the\n.toml hierarchy and not after a dict like [extra] or [markdown].\nSome themes require additional configuration before they can work properly. Be sure to follow the instructions found on your chosen theme's documentation to properly configure the theme.\n🔗Customizing a theme\nAny file from the theme can be overridden by creating a file with the same path and name in your templates or static\ndirectory. Here are a few examples of that, assuming that the theme name is simple-blog:\n\nYou can also choose to only override parts of a page if a theme defines some blocks by extending it.

To render them, set extra.table_of_contents.show = true in config.toml.\nThe table of contents is rendered inside a details element.\nIf you want the section to be collapsed on page load, set extra.table_of_contents.visible_on_load = false.\nThis defaults to true.\nIn addition, extra.table_of_contents.max_level can limit the maximum level of headers to show.\nTo show only h1s, set max_level = 1, to show h1s and h2s, set max_level = 2, and so on.\nBy default, max_level is set to 6, so all headers on the page are shown.\nBelow is an example of how to configure the table of contents in config.toml.\n\nIt can also be toggled on page-by-page basis. Add extra.hide_table_of_contents = true to the page's frontmatter to hide the table of contents for that specific page.\nIssues / Feedback / Contributing\nPlease use Codeberg issues and Pull Requests.\nSpecial Thanks 🎁\nA special thank you goes out to Herman, for creating the original ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear Blog and Jan Raasch for creating the hugo port of the Bear Blog theme.\nLicense\nMIT License © Alan Pearce\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/themes/bearblog/","title":"Bear"},"https://www.getzola.org/themes/belresume/":{"body":"BelResumé\nA beautiful, modern, and minimal single-page resume site\nPowered by Zola.

The color themes can optionally even be switched at runtime.\n\nQuick Start\nThe installation of the theme works the same as for other Zola themes. As it is described in the official documentation. Hence, it first needs to be added as a git submodule:\n\nPlease make sure to add it at the path themes/daisy in your Zola directory. The translations and the icons won't work if added to a different directory.\nAs the second step, it can be enabled then in the config.toml file of your website:\n\nFor starting to create a new Zola website using this theme, the you can also just checkout / fork the example repository and adapt it to your needs. That repository already contains a structure and configuration for the Zola-based website.\nConfiguration\nSee the following sections for information on the possible configurations for the theme in the your config.toml file.\nColor Schemes\nSet a light and dark color scheme:\n\nSee the themes list in the theme.toml for all possible identifiers. You can also set only a light or a dark color scheme, if you do not want the automatic dark mode switching based on the browser settings of your visitors.\nIf you want to allow your visitors to change the used color scheme, just set the following variable in the [extra] section of your config.toml:\n\nThere will be a dropdown in the navbar then, for the visitors to select form the color schemes.\nLanguages\nTo enable support for multiple languages, simply set the default language and add language settings for all your additional languages:\n\nTaxonomies should have exactly the same (not translated) name in all languages, for the language switching to work best.\nYou need to create an i18n file containing the translations for all theme variables for all the languages of your website, if they are not included in the theme. Right now, English, German, Hungarian, Finnish are included. You can create a the directory i18n in your website root directory and the language files in there will be picked up by the theme. It would be great, however, if you create a pull-request on the theme repository to add your translations to the theme.\nSearch\nIntegrating a search into your website is as easy as adding the following to your configuration:\n\nAs soon as build_search_index is enabled, the search indices are created for all languages that have this variable enabled in their section in the config.toml and the search bar is shown in the navbar of the website.\nJust be aware, that you need to add an Elasticlunr.js-compatible Lunr Languages file to your static directory, if you are using other languages than English and German. See the corresponding repository for the min files. Feel free to add support for your languages to the theme as well, via a pull-request.\nNavbar\nArbitrary links can be added to the footer by defining the following list in the [extra.navbar] section:\n\nThe value of the i18n_key must be in the i18n files for your languages (see en.toml, for example).\nFooter\nAll three parts of the footer can be adapted: the links, the social icons, and the copyright notice.\nLinks\nArbitrary links can be added to the footer by defining the following list in the [extra.footer] section:\n\nThe value of the i18n_key must be in the i18n files for your languages (see en.toml, for example). If the parameter no_translation is set to true, than the URL is not adapted to contain the current language code. This is needed for external links or something like the sitemap.xml in the example, that is not translated within your website.\nSocial Icons\nThe social icons in the footer can be adapted by setting any of the following variables:\n\nFor every non-empty variable, the corresponding icon is shown in the footer.\nCopyright Notice\nThe copyright notice in the footer can be set by adding the following variable in the configuration:\n\nHTML can be used there.\nCustomization\nThe page template can be extended with custom CSS or JavaScript files (or code) by inheriting the template and overwriting the blocks extra_headers or extra_javascript. The content of extra_headers will be added at the end of the &lt;head&gt; section of each page, while the content of extra_javascript will be added at the end of the &lt;body&gt; section of each page.\n\nIn most cases, however, you would probably not extent the base template, but the more specific templates like page, section, or index. As they are themselves derived from the base template you can override the extra_headers and extra_javascript blocks the same way in those cases.\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/themes/daisy/","title":"Daisy"},"https://www.getzola.org/themes/deepthought/":{"body":"\n  \n  DeepThought\n  \n    A simple blog theme focused on writing powered by Bulma and Zola.\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n    View Demo\n   · \n    Documentation\n   · \n    Report Bug\n   · \n    Request Feature\n  \n\n\n\n:notebook_with_decorative_cover: Table of Contents\n\n:notebook_with_decorative_cover: Table of Contents\n\n:star2: About the Project\n\n:camera: Screenshots\n:space_invader: Tech Stack\n:dart: Features\n\n\n:toolbox: Getting Started\n\n:bangbang: Prerequisites\n:gear: Installation\n:running: Run Locally\n:triangular_flag_on_post: Deployment\n\n\n:eyes: Usage\n\nMultilingual Navbar\nKaTeX math formula support\n\nAutomatic rendering without short codes\n\n\nElasticlunr search in other language\n\n\n:wave: Contributing\n:warning: License\n:handshake: Contact\n:gem: Acknowledgements\n\n\n\n\n:star2: About the Project\n\n:camera: Screenshots\n \n  \n\n\n:space_invader: Tech Stack\n\nZola - Your one-stop static site engine\nBulma - The modern CSS framework that just works.\n\n\n:dart: Features\n\n\nDark Mode\n\nPagination\n\nSearch\n\nCharts\n\nMaps\n\nDiagrams\n\nGalleria\n\nAnalytics\n\nComments\n\nCategories\n\nSocial Links\n\nMultilingual Navbar\n\nKatex\n\n\n:toolbox: Getting Started\n\n:bangbang: Prerequisites\nYou need static site generator (SSG) Zola installed in your machine to use this theme follow their guide on getting started.\n\n:gear: Installation\nFollow zola's guide on installing a theme.\nMake sure to add theme = \"DeepThought\" to your config.toml\nCheck zola version (only 0.9.0+)\nJust to double-check to make sure you have the right version.

It features a dark theme with a particles background, vertical arrows for navigation and a few card types which you are free to include to best suit your needs. Nearly all UI elements are subtly animated to convey a professional look (although I'm no designer 🤷 merely an embedded systems engineer).\nIt has been designed to require only Markdown editing (no HTML/CSS), but feel free to do so if you need to. I'll be glad to review a Merge Request if you implement a new card type !\n[[TOC]]\nLive demo\nSee my personal website for an example of what can be accomplished in a few minutes with this theme. Its source code is also available as an example in my Gitlab website repository.\nBuilt with\n\nZola\nParticles.js\nFont Awesome\nModern Normalize\nInspiration came from particle-zola, another theme.\n\nQuick start\nInitialize a Zola website and install HayFlow:\n\nAdd theme = \"hayflow\" at the top of config.toml file to tell Zola to use HayFlow (as described in the documentation).\nFinally, run...\n\n...and go to http://localhost:1111 to see the landing page in action with the default name displayed (John Doe).\nLanding page customization\nCustomizing the landing page boils down to two things:\n\nadding the name and links variables to the config.toml's [extra] section (links is optional. So is name if your name is John Doe)\nadding the roles variable to the content/_index.md's [extra] section (also optional)\n\nThe difference comes from the fact that you might need to translate the roles into other languages. For that to be possible, they must be placed in a MarkDown file. See multilingual support for more info.\n\nname speaks for itself.\nroles is an array of strings. Each string is displayed on a separate line.\nlinks is an array of {icon, url} objects. You can use any free icon from Font Awesome here, all you need is the icon's code. The enveloppe icon's code is fa-solid fa-envelope. The pizza-slice icon's code is fa-solid fa-pizza-slice.\n\nThis is what the config.toml's [extra] section might look like after customization:\n\nAnd here's a customized version of content/_index.md:\n\nAdding a section\nInside the content directory, create a pizza folder and place this _index.md file inside:\n\nThen, add this sections variable (an array of strings) to the config.toml's [extra] section:\n\nA new internal link pointing to that section will appear on the landing page. Click it and see what happens ! This is called a \"simple card\" section.\nCustomizing sections\nHayFlow currently supports three card types : simple, columns and list. If left unspecified, the type will default to simple. To change it, add a card_type variable to the _index.md's [extra] section:\n\nColumns card\nAdd a new section and set its card type to columns. Then, alongside the _index.md file, create three other files: one.md, two.md and three.md. These will be the ingredients of your new pizza. Their content is similar to _index.md:\n\nThe icons variable is optional.\nList card\nAdd a new section and set its card type to list. Then, alongside the _index.md file, create three other files: one.md, two.md and three.md. These will be your favourite pizzas. Their content is similar to _index.md:\n\nThe link variable is optional.\nMultilingual support\nHayFlow supports multilingual websites out of the box.\nDeclare more languages\nIn config.toml, add the languages you want to support like so:\n\nThis will make the language-select block in the top-right corner visible.

However, if you wish to change the style, or modify the template html, you might need to recompile your styles.\nThe most simple way, is to follow the installation page of tailwindcss.\nAt the end, you should have tailwindcss installed, and I advise to use the following tailwind configuration (for tailwindcss v4):\n\nCreate a file styles/styles.css, and use the following command to generate the final CSS file:\n\nor, starting with tailwindcss v4.0, the separate CLI command\n\nThe resulting file static/styles/styles.css is loaded in the html.\nNote that, for the moment the generation of the css is not automated.

It show a list of article with things that you want to share in your website.\nTo use the blog template, configure the section with the following front matter:\n\nPublications\nThe section publication is very similar to the blog section however it is dedicated to show your list of scientific articles.\nThe articles are showed in two subcategories: Thesis and Conference / Workshop.\nTo configure a publication section (e.g content/research) and set the following content:\n\nArticle are referenced in subdirectories of this section.\n\nThe bib files are automatically loaded to get information from it. However, it is also possible to add information in the front matter of the article markdown file.\n\nExtend the html header\nIn some cases, it is needed to add extra javascript or css files to be loaded by the web browsers.\nThe base template of this theme define an empty block named user_head.\nTo use this block, you can just create a new template name templates/base.html with the following content:\n\nIcons\nThe icons available in this project are stored in a dedicated macro function in templates/macros/icons.html.\nTo add a new svg, you can add a case in the if elif .. else of the function containing the svg copied from heroicons for instance.\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/themes/kodama-theme/","title":"kodama"},"https://www.getzola.org/themes/lekhz/":{"body":"lekhz\nlekhz is a simple, minimalistic, and fast personal website template for Zola.\nPorted from the Hugo theme lekh\n\nContents\n\nFeatures\nInstallation\nCustomization\n\nFeatures\n\nSocial media links\nMarkdown supported\nEasy to personalize\nRSS feed\nDark mode (taken from https://www.gwern.net/ as it is.)\nGoatCounter counts(analytics).

support\n\nInstallation\nThe fastest way to create a new site is to use the\nlinkita-start template.\nThis gives you a complete blog setup with all the essential configuration ready to go.\nManual installation\n\nCreate a new Zola site if you haven't already:\n\n\n\nAdd the theme as a git submodule:\n\n\nIf you don't want to use git submodules, you can clone the repository instead:\n\n\nEnable the theme in your config.toml file:\n\n\nPlace it near the base_url variable, not under [extra].\nManaging versions\nTo update the theme, run:\n\nIf you use the linkita branch of the theme, check the\nchangelog/linkita.md file.\nOtherwise, find the changelog file for your version in the changelog directory.\nIf you switch to a newer version, there may be breaking changes that require manual involvement.\nUsage\nLinkita uses the following front matter variables.\nAll variables are optional.\nSet the ones you need.\nYAML frontmatter\n\nTOML frontmatter\n\nOther extra front matter variables\nLinkita supports more extra variables, listed here.\nPages and Posts\nHome page\nCreate a content/_index.md file and set extra.profile to your username:\n\nDo it for each language in your site.\nFor French, the file name is content/_index.fr.md.\nSee Profiles for more.\nPosts\nIn the content directory, create a subdirectory named blog or another name of your choice.\nCreate a content/blog/_index.md file:\n\nCreate a content/blog/hello.md file:\n\nPages\nThe default page template page.html is for blog posts.\nFor pages that are not blog posts you can use the pages.html template.\nIn the content directory, create a subdirectory named pages and\ncreate a content/pages/_index.md file:\n\nCreate a content/pages/about.md file:\n\nIf you want, you can also create a page for your projects.\nSetting page authors\nChoose one of the following options or skip if you don't know what you're doing:\nOption A: Using page.authors and config.author\nThe default author for posts is set using the author variable in the config.toml file.\nYou don't need to set authors in the front matter if the default author is the only author of the post.\nOtherwise, set authors:\n\nOption B: Using Taxonomies\nUseful if the blog has a team of several authors.\nIf you choose this option you should set taxonomies in each post.\n\nInject support\nYou can easily use inject to add new features to your site without modifying the theme itself.\nTo use inject, you need to add some HTML files to the templates/injects directory.\nThe available inject points are: head.html, head_end.html, header_nav.html,\nbody_start.html, body_end.html, page_start.html, page_end.html, footer.html.\nFor example, you can add JavaScript files and CSS stylesheets in the templates/injects/head_end.html file.\nKeyboard shortcuts\nActionShortcut\nHomeAlt+!\nSearchAlt+/\nToggle menuAlt++\nToggle dark modeAlt+$\nGo to prev pageAlt+,\nGo to next pageAlt+.\nTable of contentsAlt+=\nSkip to footerAlt+_\n\nConfiguration\nCopy and paste the examples into your config.toml file\nand comment out the variables you don't use instead of setting empty values.\nAll variables are optional.\n\nZola has built-in support for taxonomies.\nLinkita has special support for taxonomies named tags, categories, and authors.\n\nYou can add more languages by replacing fr from the following example with the language code:\n\nBy default, taxonomy pages are sorted in descending order by the number of posts.\nYou can customize this behavior using the extra.taxonomy_sorting variable:\n\nGeneral config\n\nStyle config\n\nMenus\n\nTo use a menu, set extra.header_menu_name.\n$BASE_URL in url will be automatically replaced with the language specific base url.\nYou can use Internal links\ninstead of $BASE_URL.\nIf your site is multilingual, you can choose one of the following options or combine them:\n\nSet names as in the multilingual_menu_name example.\nSet extra.menu_i18n to true in order to use the static/i18n/menu.json file.\nSet header_menu_name for each language using the language specific options.\n\nProfiles\n\nProfile translations\nSkip if your site is not multilingual.\n\nOpen Graph for profiles\nSee the Open Graph protocol.\n\nimage and image_alt of the default author's profile will be used\nas a fallback open graph image for all pages.\nOpen Graph translations\nSkip if your site is not multilingual.\n\nThe page footer\n\nThe copyright variable supports Markdown,\n$BASE_URL, $YEAR (uses since), and $LICENSE_URL (uses license_url).\nLanguage specific options\nFor date format, see chrono docs.\n\n\nWeb analytics\nGoatCounter\nSet only if you use GoatCounter.\n\nVercel Analytics\nSet only if you use Vercel Web Analytics.\n\nPrevent tracking own pageviews\nOpen a page of your site, adding #disable-analytics to the page address.\nDo this once for each browser and device.\nFor example, open http://127.0.0.1:1111/#disable-analytics.\nComments\nSee giscus.app.\nOnly available when extra.comment in the front matter or extra.comment in the config is set to true.\n\nContributing\nThis project is under the MIT License.\nPull requests are welcome on Codeberg and GitHub.\nThe main branch is linkita.\nLocalization\nFeel free to contribute new translations or improve existing ones.\nTo add a new language, create a file LANG_CODE.json in the static/i18n directory.\nSee ISO 639-1 codes.\n\nSee also the static/i18n/menu.json file and\nthe demo repository.\nLive preview is available in the following

creating fast, SEO-optimized blogs.\nPut your work front and center with Mabuya as the base of your project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nⓘ Background\nWhile searching for themes, I stumbled upon Tale. Unfortunately, the last update was on December, 2021. Soon after, I decided to fork the project and add my own touches to it.\nThe name Mabuya comes from the Mabuya hispaniolae, a possibly extinct1 species of skink endemic to the Dominican Republic, my home country.\n✨ Features\n\n✅ Simple Blog\n✅ Pagination\n✅ Tags\n✅ Dark Theme and Toggle\n✅ Back-to-Top Button\n\n📈 Improvements\nWhile working on the theme, I have added new functionality and made many quality of life improvements. Here's a short list:\n\nRefactored stylesheets to make it easier to grok.\nAdded a dark theme and toggle.\nAdded new footer navigation.\nCreated a custom GitHub Action to deploy Zola sites faster than any other GitHub Actions without using Docker.\nRefined page transitions from desktop to mobile and viceversa.\nCentralized custom variables to make it easier to customize the site's colors.\nAddressed PR #7 fixing the pagination problem present in the original Zola theme.\nAddressed Issue #4 fixing custom text not being used correctly.\nAddressed (temporarily) Issue #1 by removing the erroneous pinned marker.\nOptimized for speed and accessibility. Subtle color changes to make the text more readable, etc.\nMany other small improvements eventually resulting in a perfect PageSpeed Insights score:\n\n\n\n\n\n🚀 Quick Start\nBefore using the theme, you need to install Zola ≥ v0.18.0. After which you'll need to:\n\nClone the repository:\n\n\n\nChange directory into new cloned repository:\n\n\n\nServe the site locally:\n\n\nFor more detailed instructions, visit the documentation page about installing and using themes.\n🎨 Customization\nYou can change the configuration, templates and content yourself. Refer to the config.toml, and templates for ideas. In most cases you only need to modify the contents of config.toml to customize the appearance of your blog. Make sure to visit the Zola Documentation.\nAdding custom CSS is as easy as adding your styles to sass/_custom.scss. This is made possible because SCSS files are backwards compatible with CSS. This means you can type normal CSS code into a SCSS file and it will be valid.\n🔄 Workflows\n🔨 Build only\n\n📢 Deployment\n\n🚩 Reporting Issues\nWe use GitHub Issues as the official bug tracker for Mabuya. Please search existing issues. It’s possible someone has already reported the same problem. If your problem or idea is not addressed yet, open a new issue.\n🤝 Contributing\nWe'd love your help! Please see CONTRIBUTING and our Code of Conduct before submitting a Pull Request.\n💜 Acknowledgements\nMabuya is a fork of Tale, which itself is a port of the Jekyll theme Tale which is now archived.\nThe icons used throughout the site are kindly provided by UXWing.

Each chapter should be a folder inside /content, which contains its sections (markdown files). Here is an example of the file structure:\n\nIn /content folder, there should be one _index.md, which contains title and welcome/preface infomation of the book. In its front matter, you should set sort_by = \"weight\"  to manually control the order of chapters (or you can use sort by slug or date for your notebook).\nEach chapter(folder) must have an _index.md file. It should sets its weight front-matter variable to its chapter number, and set sort_by = \"weight\" in its front matter.\nThen in each chapter(folder), each section should be a page and should have its weight variable set to its section\nnumber.\nIf you don't want welcome/preface page of the book or of a chapter, you can use redirect_to front-matter variable in the corresponding _index.md.\nYou can write a shell scripts to automate creating new chapters or new notes. For example, you can consult my zshconfig project on my github (If you can not see it, probably it is bacasue I currently make it private. You can email me for access.)\nHotkeys\nIn a browser, you can always type ? to toggle the help page, reminding you of hotkeys.\nThe rule is inspired by Vim, Zathura, and Olivine.\nThe list of hotkeys may keep expanding, so I will not list all here. You can use ? the help page, or see hotkeys.js manually to check existing functions.\nThe hotkey i will allow you to idle inside MATRIX (inspired by cmatrix), and since MAT is both initials for matrix and math, I lazily named this project after it.\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/themes/matbook/","title":"MATbook"},"https://www.getzola.org/themes/minimal-dark/":{"body":"\nGeneral\nI am not the best webmaster, but should be somewhat responsive.\nI intentionally using the bigger fonts to make, feel free to change it in main.scss\nLight mode\nNow light mode also supported.\nImportant\nPlease make sure to set up your base_url with trailing slash:\n\nComments\nTheme supports Giscuss for comments.

If you don't want the \"Other\" category displayed, you can copy the templates/projects.html to your own templates directory and delete/comment out the \"Other\" category code.\nExample categories.json:\n\nExample project page front matter:\n\nThe example project page above would be grouped into &amp; displayed within the \"Software\" category of your projects page.\nLight/dark mode\nThe Papaya theme can be set to \"light\", \"dark\", or \"auto\" mode in the config.toml.\nIn \"auto\", the light and dark modes are implicitly chosen by the prefers-color-scheme CSS media feature. The theme will switch automatically based on the viewer's OS or user agent setting.\nMultilingual support\nCurrently Zola has basic internationalization (i18n) support, you can read more in zola's Multilingual Sites doc.\nTo write a multilingual site, follow the steps below (English and Chinese in this example):\n\n\nAdd a default_language configuration and [languages.zh] and [languages.en] sections to your config.toml:\n\nUnder the [languages.zh] section you can override default configurations like title, description, etc.\n\n\nAdd translations of all keywords in [languages.zh.translations] and languages.en.translations] sections (see Papaya's config.toml for a listing of all keywords):\n\n\n\nAdd a _index.zh.md file into every section.\nFor example: add content/blog/_index.zh.md and content/projects/_index.zh.md.\n\n\nProvide a {page-name}.zh.md (or index.zh.md into the page's directory, if it has one) for every page you'd like to translate.\nFor example: add content/blog/what-is-zola.zh.md and content/blog/blog-with-image/index.zh.md.\n\n\nAdd a content/categories.zh.json file. For example:\n\n\n\nNow you will have a website that supports both English and Chinese! Since default_language in config.toml is set to \"en\", by visiting {base_url} you will see the English version of this blog. You can visit the Chinese version by visiting {base_url}/zh.\nA page (post or project) can be available in both languages or only in one language, and it's not necessary that a page is available in the default language.\nSections and navigation menu links\nThe navigation menu is constructed from a list of menu_items in your config.toml. For example:\n\nA menu_item can be one of two things:\n\n\na link to a section. Section links can be optionally configured to display its most recently authored items on your index page. See Configuring section menu items.\n\n\na link to a URL. See Configuring URL menu items\n\n\nConfiguring section menu items\nA section is created whenever a directory (or subdirectory) in the content section contains an _index.md file; see the Zola docs on sections.\nPapaya has two sections by default: projects and blog. You can add additional sections or change section names.  For example, you can add a section called Diary. In order to add this section, you need to:\n\n\nCreate a directory called diary in content/.\n\n\nCreate an _index.md inside content/diary/, for example:\n\n\n\nSections can be added to the navigation menu, and optionally configured to display its most recently authored items on your index page. To add your section to the navigation menu:\n\n\nIn your config.toml under the [extra] section, add your section to the menu_items:\n\n\n\nIn your config.toml under the [languages.&lt;code&gt;.translations] section, add your section name translation keys:\n\nThis will add a simple hyperlink to your new Diary section in the navigation menu.\n\n\nTo also display recently authored items from your Diary section on your index page:\n\n\nAdd the following attributes to your menu item:\n\nshow_recent: Adds the section's recent items listing to your index page.\nrecent_items: Number of recent items to display.\nrecent_trans_key: Translation key for the recent items listing title text.\nmore_trans_key: Translation key for the hyperlink text to the section.\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\nIn your config.toml under the [languages.&lt;code&gt;.translations] section, add your section name, recent_trans_key, and more_trans_key translation keys:\n\nThis will add both a hyperlink to your new Diary section in the navigation menu, and a listing of the three most recent items from your Diary section on your index page.\n\n\nConfiguring URL menu items\nIf you want to add a simple link to the navigation menu, add an item with a name and url. For example:\n\nA translation key for your link's name must be added into your config.toml:\n\nIf you include $BASE_URL in the URL of a link it will be replaced with the base URL of your site, and $LANG_BASE_URL will be replaced with the language-specific base URL of your site.\nPost/project date formats\nYou can have different date formats in different languages. You need to set the date_format value in every langauge's translation section.\nExample:\n\nThe formatting uses the standard date filter in Tera. The date format options you can use are listed in the chrono crate documentation.\nPost/project featured images\nPosts and projects can have featured images which display at the top of their page before the page contents.\n\n\nFeatured images can also be extended to the full width of the viewport:\n\n\nOpen Graph Protocol locale/profile information\nIn your config.toml you can add a [extra.ogp] section to specify your Open Graph Protocol locale and profile information.\nOpen Graph Protocol provides you control over how your website's content should be displayed on social media sites.\nFor the more information on Open Graph Protocol and valid property values, visit the official website.\nExample:\n\nUtterances\nUtterances is a comments widget built on GitHub issues. When enabled, Papaya can display GitHub issues as comments on your blog posts.\nTo enable:\n\n\nFollow instructions on the utterances website.\n\n\nOnce you're at the \"Enable Utterances\" step, enter the following keys into your config.toml:\n\n\n\nSocial/contact links\nIn your config.toml you can add a [extra.social] section to specify your social network/contact accounts. Changing these will update what links appear on your website's footer.\nExample:\n\nIf you want to include other custom social websites, you can add them to other:\nExample:\n\nThe font_awesome attribute specifies the Font Awesome classes; you can find them in Font Awesome. Be aware that different versions of Font Awesome may include different sets of icons; you can change your version of Font Awesome by updating the CDN path in the [extra.cdn] section:\n\nImage embedding shortcode\nIncluded with Papaya is a shortcode for embedding images into your posts:\n\nYou can use ./&lt;image-path&gt; to specify the relative path of image which is relative to current markdown file.\nArguments\n\n\npath: The path to the image. It can be either:\n\na full path (eg: https://somesite.com/my-image.jpg),\nrelative to the content directory in the directory structure (eg: @/projects/project-1/my-image.jpg), or\nrelative to the current markdown file (eg: ./my-image.jpg).\n\n\n\nalt: (optional) The alternate text for the image.\n\n\ncaption: (optional) A caption for the image. Text/HTML/Tera templates supported.\n\n\nclass: (optional) Any CSS classes to assign to the image. Multiple classes should be separated with a space (\" \").\n\n\nquality: (optional) JPEG or WebP quality of the image, in percent.  Only used when encoding JPEGs or WebPs; default value is 90.\n\n\nextended_width_pct: (optional) The percentage by which the image's width should be expanded past it's default figure width, up to maximum configured pixel width.\nRange is 0.0-1.0, or -1 for document width.\nMax pixel width can be defined in your config.toml  with the extra.images.max_width property (2500px default).\nSee Extended width images section for more details and examples.\n\n\nThe benefits of using this shortcode over regular Markdown/HTML image embedding are:\n\nImages are automatically resized for best performance, using Zola's image processing functions\nImages &amp; captions are ✨pre-styled✨ for you\nImages can have their width extended past the document's width (see: Extended width images\nLess HTML/CSS boilerplate to write\n\nExtended width images\nImages embedded into pages using the img shortcode can be configured to extend past their document width. This is especially nice for displaying wide/landscape images at higher resolutions.\nBy default, images embedded with the img shortcode will be inserted as a figure with default margins:\n\n\nWith the extended_width_pct argument, we can specify a percentage of how much the image should expand outside its default figure width, up to your maximum configured image width (config.extra.images.max_width, 2500px default).\nHere's an example with extended_width_pct=0.1:\n\n\nThe image is now displayed with a 10% larger width, while maintaining its original aspect ratio.\nHere's an even wider example:\n\n\nThe images will resize in resolution up to your maximum configured image width, and will display on the webpage up to the maximum width of the viewport.\nYou can also force the image width to match the document's width by setting extended_width_pct to -1:\n\n\nWhy \"Papaya\"?\n🦎\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/themes/papaya/","title":"Papaya"},"https://www.getzola.org/themes/papermod-2/":{"body":"Zola PaperMod\nThis repository is the unofficial successor to cydave's papermod!\nThis theme is the backbone of my site Seq.rs\nand will primarily be updated to meet my needs for that site.\nWith that being said, if others have additions they'd like to see, you're more\nthan welcome to open a pull request on this fork!\n\nA work in progress port of the hugo-PaperMod\ntheme by @adityatelange to Zola\nDue to config changes introduced with Zola 0.19, only Zola 0.19.1 and later are\ncurrently supported.\nDemo @ https://dawnandrew100.github.io/zola-theme-papermod-2/\nFeatures\n\n\nBlog post archive\n\nBlog post RSS feeds\n\nTags\n\nTag-based RSS feeds\n\nOptional: Custom taxonomies\n\nLight / Dark theme switching (with configurable default preference)\n\nSyntax highlighting for code snippets (Zola's built-in syntax highlighting)\n\nCustom navigation\n\nHide pages from home page by adding extra = {exclude_from_home = true} to front matter or adding markdown file to content/static/ folder\n\nCode copy buttons\n\nSearch page\n\nSEO Metadata\n\nLanguage switcher (multi-language support)\n\nInstallation\n\nDownload the Theme\n\n\n\nAdd theme = \"papermod_2\" to your zola config.toml\nCopy over the example content to get started\n\n\nSwitching from papermod to papermod_2\n\nRemove papermod submodule\n\n\n\nDownload papermod_2\n\n\nOptions\nPapermod customizations exist under a designated extra.papermod section.\nRefer to config.toml for available options.\nContributing\nIf you would like to help out with porting hugo-Papermod to Zola, feel free to pick\nup a feature and start working on it.

The theme is based on the Blow theme that was created by Thomas Chartron and on my generic Daisy theme. It extends the Daisy with specific pages, taxonomies and shortcodes for managing a project portfolio and supports all color schemes of the Daisy as well.\n\nCheck out the live demo of the example project  or a real-world implementation of this theme.\nFeatures\n\nResponsive design (looks good on desktop and mobile)\nAutomatically selected dark / light modes\n37 color schemes included\nCustomizable navbar and footer (with social links)\nProject types and skills taxonomies\nSearch functionality\nMulti-language support\nPagination\nCustomizable favicon\nError 404 page\n\nQuick Start\nFor starting to create a new Zola website using this theme, the easiest approach is to just checkout / fork the example repository and adapt it to your needs. That repository already contains a minimal structure and configuration for the Zola-based website and can directly be built and deployed to Netlify and Github pages.\nConfiguration\nThe minimal config.toml file for using the theme looks like this:\n\nColor Schemes\nSet a light and dark color scheme:\n\nSee the themes list in the theme.toml for all possible identifiers. You can also set only a light or a dark color scheme, if you do not want the automatic dark mode switching based on the browser settings of your visitors.\nIf you want to allow your visitors to change the used color scheme, just set the following variable in the [extra] section of your config.toml:\n\nThere will be a dropdown in the navbar then, for the visitors to select form the color schemes.\nLanguages\nTo enable support for multiple languages, simply set the default language and add language settings for all your additional languages:\n\nTaxonomies should have exactly the same (not translated) name in all languages, for the language switching to work best.\nYou need to create an i18n file containing the translations for all theme variables for all the languages of your website, if they are not included in the theme. Right now, English, German, Hungarian, Finnish are included. You can create a the directory i18n in your website root directory and the language files in there will be picked up by the theme. It would be great, however, if you create a pull-request on the theme repository to add your translations to the theme.\nSearch\nIntegrating a search into your website is as easy as adding the following to your configuration:\n\nAs soon as build_search_index is enabled, the search indices are created for all languages that have this variable enabled in their section in the config.toml and the search bar is shown in the navbar of the website.\nJust be aware, that you need to add an Elasticlunr.js-compatible Lunr Languages file to your static directory, if you are using other languages than English and German. See the corresponding repository for the min files. Feel free to add support for your languages to the theme as well, via a pull-request.\nNavbar\nArbitrary links can be added to the footer by defining the following list in the [extra.navbar] section:\n\nThe value of the i18n_key must be in the i18n files for your languages (see en.toml, for example).\nFooter\nAll three parts of the footer can be adapted: the links, the social icons, and the copyright notice.\nLinks\nArbitrary links can be added to the footer by defining the following list in the [extra.footer] section:\n\nThe value of the i18n_key must be in the i18n files for your languages (see en.toml, for example). If the parameter no_translation is set to true, than the URL is not adapted to contain the current language code. This is needed for external links or something like the sitemap.xml in the example, that is not translated within your website.\nSocial Icons\nThe social icons in the footer can be adapted by setting any of the following variables:\n\nFor every non-empty variable, the corresponding icon is shown in the footer.\nCopyright Notice\nThe copyright notice in the footer can be set by adding the following variable in the configuration:\n\nHTML can be used there.\nSyntax Highlighting\nThe theme makes use of Zola code highlighting feature and supports setting a different color scheme depending on whether a light or dark theme is active. Just enable syntax highlighting the following way:\n\nIndex Page\nA title and text can be added to the index page by creating a file _index.md in the content directory. Additionally, a slogan and an image an be configured in the config.toml:\n\nYou can also created a completely different index page, by overwriting the index.html template in the template directory of your site. Just inherit from the page.html template of the theme.\nDetails on Using the Theme\nThe installation of the theme works the same as for other Zola themes. As it is described in the official documentation. Hence, it fist needs to be added as a git submodule:\n\nPlease make sure to add it at the path themes/project-portfolio in your Zola directory. The translations and the icons won't work if added to a different directory.\nIn the config.toml file it needs to be selected then:\n\nCreate the files projects.md and skills.md in your content directory that are used to show the \"Projects\" and \"Skills\" taxonomies. They both need a title and can optionally get a descriptive text that will be shown above the terms of the taxonomy. See the following projects.md file as an example:\n\nIt would be shown with the configured title and content like this above the terms:\n\nThe skills.md file can be created the same way. The corresponding page will just show the terms of the skills taxonomy instead of the terms of the projects taxonomy then.\nFinally, create the first project page in the content directory:\n\n\n\nThe generated project site would then look like this:\n\nCustomization\nThe page template can be extended with custom CSS or JavaScript files (or code) by inheriting the template and overwriting the blocks extra_headers or extra_javascript. The content of extra_headers will be added at the end of the &lt;head&gt; section of each page, while the content of extra_javascript will be added at the end of the &lt;body&gt; section of each page.\n\nIn most cases, however, you would probably not extent the base template, but the more specific templates like page, section, or index. As they are themselves derived from the base template you can override the extra_headers and extra_javascript blocks the same way in those cases.\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/themes/project-portfolio/","title":"Project Portfolio"},"https://www.getzola.org/themes/radion/":{"body":"radion\nA sleek, modern blog theme for Zola.

This file controls how your home page looks and behaves. Choose one of the following options:\nOption A: Serve posts from /:\n\n\nThis will display posts in content/ with pagination.\n\nOption B: Serve posts from a different path (e.g., blog/):\n\n\nThis will display the latest 5 posts from the blog/ section.\nDo not set paginate_by if you choose this option.\nUse the full path to the section's _index.md file. Using section_path = \"blog/\" will not work.\n\n\n\n\n[!WARNING]\nDo not set both paginate_by and section_path in content/_index.md.\nThese settings are mutually exclusive and using both may result in no posts being displayed.\n\n\nIf you want an introduction section (see screenshot above), add these lines to content/_index.md:\n\n\nThe content outside the front matter will be rendered between the header title and the posts listing. In the screenshot above, it's the text that reads \"tabi is a fast, lightweight, and modern Zola theme…\".\n\nIf you want a multilingual site, you will need to set up each language. In config.toml, set the title and taxonomies for each language, like:\n\n\nYou will need an _index.{language_code}.md per language for each section (e.g. /blog or /projects) that you want to enable in that language.\nThe same is true for individual posts, which should have the exact same name as the default language, with an extra .{code} before the extension (e.g. the Spanish version of security.md would be security.es.md).\nThis configuration allows the language switcher to take the user to the translation of the current URL. If a translation doesn't exist, the 404 page will be displayed, with an explanation in each language set in the config.\nTo learn more about multilingual support, see the Frequently Asked Questions.\nUpdating tabi\nIf you added the theme as a git submodule, run:\n\nIf you cloned it:\n\nSites using tabi\nWebsiteCreatorDescriptionSite Source\nosc.gardenÓscar Fernández (welpo)Data science, psychology, and ZolaSource\nseadve.github.ioDave Patrick Caberto (SeaDve)Personal blog and portfolio with custom CSSSource\nmikufan.pageNadiaPersonal blogSource\ntim-boettcher.onlineTim BöttcherInsights and ramblings of a deafblind programmerSource\nwww.richtman.auAriel RichtmanPersonal tech blogSource\nPonderosa GamesJohn Burak (JVimes)A friendly indie game company—\njmbhughes.comMarcus Hughes (jmbhughes)Personal blogSource\nszabolcs.meSzabolcs Fazekas (szabolcsf)Personal blogSource\nNizzlayNiels Gouman (Nizzlay)Personal blogSource\nZzMzaw's blogZzMzaw (ZzMzaw)Personal blogSource\nidle-ti.meJérôme Ramette (be-next)Personal blogSource\ntzinm.meTzinmPersonal blogSource\nb1n.iob1nhackLinux kernel vulnerability researcherSource\nposixlycorrect.comFabian MonteroPersonal homepageSource\n\nUsing tabi?

The icons have also been changed to align better with Tailwind.\nUsage\n\nCheck the USAGE.md of main branch.\n\nContributing\n\nBefore you make any non-trivial changes, consider opening an issue so we can discuss the change.\n\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/themes/tranquil/","title":"tranquil"},"https://www.getzola.org/themes/vonge/":{"body":"Vonge Zola Theme\n\nThis is a Zola port of the Vonge Hugo Bookshop template, originally created by CloudCannon and licensed under the MIT License.\nVonge is a clean, modern theme for personal portfolios, blogs, or landing pages.

All of these items are important, but it is fundamental to create two taxonomies at least:\n\nRemember that all descriptions (config.description and page.description) are shown on the index page, one at the header and the others through the body.\nExtras\nZOLA.386 comes with a lot of extra variables which eases the creation and maintenance of the site, so it's important to review all of them after installing the theme.\nThe zola386_menu composes the navbar and is created by setting up a path, which will be appended to the base_url and the name will appear on the navbar.\n\nSocial\nZOLA.386 is also prepared to deal with Google Analytics, Disqus, and Twitter --Open Graph Protocol is welcome.  This theme is prepared to use the output of Favicon Generator, to do so, you'll just need to download the output of that site and extract in static/images.\nAs said, Disqus is supported, but besides setting the username in config.toml, you also must to put a comments = true extra option on the pages where Disqus will be enabled --this gives you the freedom to enable or disable comments on certain posts.  You can use the extra option image on each page, to represent that post.\nAnimations\nAll JavaScript animations can be set at static/js/zola386.js.  Basically you can disable all animations, use one or two scans, and change the scan speed.  Personally, I prefer only one scan with a speed factor of 5.\nLanguage\nUnder the label_ variables, you can set names to better localize your site.  Note that you can change the language of a single page, by using page.extra.lang, which causes &lt;html lang=\"\"&gt; to change only on that page.  A theme to provide information for its owner and SEO-friendly.\nSearch\nSearch was implemented according to the official documentation.  It uses JavaScript to search on an indexed version of the site based on search_index.LANG.js, elasticlunr.min.js, and search.js --the first two are generated after each build.  If you're running your site in other default language other than English, you must change the search_index.LANG.js line in index.html, setting up LANG accordingly.\nOther files\nThe content\\_index.md file must be properly configured to provide better experience.  Check out this file for more information.\nThe 404 page is almost hardcoded, so you must edit it directly.\nLicense\nThis theme is released under the MIT license.  For more information read the License.\n\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/themes/zola-386/","title":"zola.386"},"https://www.getzola.org/themes/zola-easydocs-theme/":{"body":"An easy way to create a document library for your project\nDemo: https://easydocs.codeandmedia.com/\nThis theme for Zola (static site engine) helps you build and publish your project docs easily and fast. Zola is just one binary that outputs html-pages and additional static assets after building your docs written in Markdown. Thus, you can take the theme, your md-files, Zola and gain flexible and simple website for documentation.\nStep-by-step\nAs you may have heard Zola is quite flexible :) So, the scenario below is one of hundreds possible ways to make things done, feel free to find your best. Also, Zola provides their own mechanism to install and use themes, see the docs.\n\nFork the repo and replace demo-content inside content folder with yours. But take a look to _index.md files. It contains title and when you want to have anchor right of your headers add insert_anchor_links = \"right\" to each index. theme.toml, screenshot and readme may be deleted too.\nInside config.toml change URL and title on your own. In extra section you can specify path to your GitHub API for version below the logo on nav, favicon and logo itself. Or just remove the lines if you don't need it. Also, you can configure or turn on some additional settings related to Zola. Specification is here.\nIn sass/_variables.scss you may change font, color or background if you want.\nAlmost done. Now, you should decide how you want to build and where will be hosted your website. You can build it locally and upload to somewhere. Or build in GitHub Actions and host on GitHub Pages / Netlify / CloudFlare Pages / AnyS3CloudStorage. Howto for GitHub Pages. My example of GitHub workflow with 2-steps build (the first checks for links and spelling errors, the second uploads to Azure). Dockerfile to make Docker image.\n\nProvided configurations options\nThese options can be configured in the extra section of the config.toml.\nIf any are not present it has the same behaviour as the default which is shown in the starter config.toml.\n\neasydocs_logo_always_clickable controls if the logo is always clickable. By default the logo is only clickable if you are not on the home page. If this is enabled it will make the logo clickable when you are on the home page as well. Thus on the home page it will basically just refresh the page as it will take you to the same page.\neasydocs_uglyurls provides support for offline sites that do not use a webserver. If set to true links in the nav are generated with the full path indcluding index.html. This functionality was  insired by Abridge theme. Note that for this to work it also requries the base URL to be set to the local folder where the site will be stored eg. base_url = file:///home/user/mysite/public/. Therefore this is not portable and only works with a specific local folder, but does not require a webserver to navigate the site.\neasydocs_heading_threshold controls minimum number of headings needed on a page before the headings show in the navigation on the left. Defaults to 5. Can be used for example to always show headings on each page by setting it to 1.\n\nEnjoy your docs!\n\nIcons: Office UI Fabric Icons\nCopy-code-button: Aaron Luna\n\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/themes/zola-easydocs-theme/","title":"EasyDocs"},"https://www.getzola.org/themes/zola-folio/":{"body":"*folio\n\n*folio is a Zola theme forked from the original Jekyll theme by Lia Boegev.\nLive Demo\nFeatures\n\n\nMenu bar\n\nSocial links\n\nTags\n\nMathJax\n\nSearch\n\nCustomizable color\n\nSEO tags\n\nMulti-language support\n\nInstallation\nIn the git repo of your zola site:\nAdd the theme as a git submodule:\n\nOr clone the theme directly into your themes directory:\n\nThen set theme = \"zola-folio\" in your config.toml file.

To enable them, create\na \"tags\" taxonomy in your config.toml:\n\nEnabling tags will create a new /tags page, and\ncause them to show up in archive section. Note\nthat you still need to create a menu link to the tags\npage manually.\nPagination\nPagination is fully supported for post list (main site)\nand intra-post (you can navigate to earlier and later posts).\nTo make sure pagination works properly, you must first configure\nit in content/_index.md:\n\nThen, tweak the theme's pagination config in config.toml:\n\nLanguage code\nInternationalization / translation is not supported\nbut you can set the HTML language code for your\nsite:\n\nHack font subset\nBy default, the theme uses a mixed subset of the Hack font.\nNormal weight font uses full character set\n(for Unicode icons and special symbols), but all others\n(bold, italic etc) use a limited subset.\nThis results in much smaller transfer sizes, but the subset\nmight not contain all the Unicode characters you need.\nYou can enable full unicode support in config.toml:\n\nAlso see Hack's docs.\nFavicon\nThe theme supports adding a global favicon (applies to\nall pages) to the site:\n\nPage titles\nThe theme allows you to configure how the page titles (the &lt;title&gt; elements) are rendered.\nUse \"combined\" to render titles as \"Page title | Main title\".\n\nAll the configuration options are also described in\nconfig.toml.\nExtending\nEach of the templates defines named blocks, so\nit should be quite easy to customize the most common things.\nFor example, if you want to add extra &lt;meta&gt; tags to the\nbase template, index.html, create file like this in templates/index.html:\n\nHow to contribute\nIf you spot any bugs or wish to contribute new features, please create a new\nPull Request.\nChanges compared to the original theme\nThis theme has been forked from https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal\n\n\nSlight changes in the layout and styling.\n\nContent has been centered (instead of left-aligned).\nThe header stripes have been spaced out.\nTweaks to pagination, especially on mobile (small screens).\nThe post title underline is dashed instead of doubly-dotted.\nAll links are underlined, as per\nBrutalist Web Design Guidelines.\nTweaks to header font sizes.\nMinor footer tweaks.\n\n\n\nAbsolutely no JavaScript.\n\nNo JavaScript needed to pre-process anything.\nZola with its Sass pre-processor is the only dependency.\nThere's no menu trigger.\nThings load crazy fast, as it's all static content.\nPrism.js syntax highlighting is not supported (you can use\nZola's).\n\n\n\nAll references to social media (e.g. Twitter) have been removed.\n\n\nAll references to external URLs (e.g. Google CDN) have been removed.\nThis theme's static assets are meant to be served from where it's hosted.\n\n\nHack is the default font.\n\n\nThe default color theme is blue (original uses orange).\n\n\nNew features\n\nYou can pick the accent color as well as background color.\nThere's a new dark background. See Configuration\nbelow for details.\nActive \"section\" links will change color indicating the\nactive section.

Juli 2023; 1.234 Wörter instead.\nNot only the text should be translated, but also the date and number formats are different.\nAnd you want a text like 1 word or 1 Wort, because the singular form should be used where applicable.\nThis theme takes care of that.\nTo localize your blog with this theme:\n\n\nPick your desired language by setting the default_language in config.toml.\nAs of now, English (en) and German (de) have language resources available in the i18n directory.\nIf your language is not supported yet, just create a new resource file with your translations.\nUse the file en.toml as a template for your own translations.\nUse the correct language code for the file name, e.g. eo.toml for Esperanto.\nThis theme supports only languages that read from left-to-right (ltr).\n\n\nThe theme will automatically display all theme-specific string resources in the chosen language.\n\n\nThe content that you provide should match this language.\nBut that is your responsibility.\nThe theme will not translate your content.\n\n\nIf you need to define your own date format, look here for supported specifiers.\n\nIntegrating the theme folder\nThis project is structured as a stand-alone Zola site.\nThis section is for those who might want to integrate the theme into an existing Zola website.\nYou can do so by moving the relevant theme files to the themes/zolarwind directory.\nAll other files stay in the root directory.\nIf you have your own files there, you need to merge them with the ones from this theme.\nYou also need to adjust the config.toml and package.json files in the root accordingly.\nI will only show you the relevant directories that need to be moved.\nThis is the directory structure of the stand-alone site, where the theme is in the root directory:\n\nCreate a new directory themes/zolarwind and move the following files and directories there:\n\nThe static/css directory is a special case.\nIt contains the generated Tailwind CSS file with the name generated.css.\nIt will stay in its original location.\nThis file is generated from the file css/main.css, which is the input for the CSS generation.\nThe generation process can be triggered with a script in the package.json file.\nYou only need to adjust and run the script in package.json if you make changes to the theme's template files or use new Tailwind CSS classes directly in your content files.\nSince the source file css/main.css has moved to the directory themes/zolarwind/css/main.css, we need to adjust the script in package.json accordingly.\nThis is what the relevant part of it looks like for the stand-alone site:\n\nNow change it so that the input file css/main.css will be the file themes/zolarwind/css/main.css:\n\nSince you now use Zolarwind as a theme, you need to declare it in the config.toml file.\nThe theme's files have moved to the directory themes/zolarwind, so you need to adjust the only reference to the theme's files in the config.toml file accordingly by changing the path_language_resources entry:\n\n\nDevelopment\nIf you want to adjust the CSS of the theme to your needs, you will need to edit the files in the templates and css\ndirectories. While you do this, you should make sure that the CSS file static/css/generated.css is up to date. This\nfile is generated from the file css/main.css, and all the files that Tailwind automatically identifies via automatic\ncontent detection.\nIf you ever need to explicitly add a source file excluded by default, you can always add it with the @source\ndirective, right in your css/main.css file:\n\nSo whenever one of these files changes, you need to run the script css:build from the package.json file.\nTo achieve this, you need to have Node.js and all dependencies from package.json installed (with npm install).\nThen you can run the script with npm run css:watch.\nIt monitors all files mentioned above and triggers the CSS generation whenever a relevant file changes.\nThis ensures, that the file static/css/generated.css is always up to date.\nI recommend having two terminals open.\nIn one terminal, run npm run server - or just zola serve - to start the Zola server.\nIn the other terminal, run npm run css:watch to start the CSS generation whenever a relevant file changes.\nThat way, your local web browser will automatically reload the page with the updated CSS whenever you change a file.\n\nRemarks\nTypography for Markdown\nI'm not using @tailwindcss/typography for styling of Markdown files.\nI don't like how it looks.\nInstead, I use @apply in the css/main.css file.\nThe @apply directive in Tailwind CSS enables you to compose utility classes into custom CSS classes.\nThis makes it possible to apply multiple utility styles within a single class, making it efficient to style Markdown content.\nThis approach has pros and cons.\nBut it gives me fine-grained control over how the result looks like.\nWhile it is time-consuming, I prefer this solution over the @tailwindcss/typography plugin.\nYes, I'm reinventing the wheel here, because for common typographic patterns, I'm just recreating what's already provided by the typography plugin.\nServe KaTex files locally\nAll KaTex files are included in the static directory for this theme.\nUsing KaTeX (or any other library) by serving it from a Content Delivery Network (CDN) has implications concerning the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the use of cookies:\n\n\nThird-Party Requests &amp; Data Privacy: When you load resources from a CDN, it triggers third-party requests to the CDN's servers.\nThese servers might log your IP address, user agent, and other request-related metadata.\nUnder GDPR, IP addresses can be considered personal data.\nBy serving KaTeX from your domain, you reduce third-party data transfers, limiting the amount of personal data you expose to external entities.\n\n\nCookies: Many CDNs set cookies for various reasons, including analytics or performance optimizations.\nThese cookies can track users across different websites that use the same CDN, potentially infringing on their privacy rights.\nBy hosting KaTeX on your domain, you have full control over cookies and can ensure compliance with GDPR.\n\n\nConsent: If you're using a CDN that sets cookies or collects data, you might need to get explicit user consent before loading resources from that CDN.\nThis can complicate user experience and lead to a reduced site performance for users who opt-out.\nBy self-hosting, you circumvent this issue.\n\n\nTransparency &amp; Control: By self-hosting, you know exactly which version of KaTeX you're using and can ensure there are no modifications or unexpected behaviors.\nWith CDNs, there's a minor risk of the library being compromised, which could affect all sites using that resource.\n\n\nData Transfer Outside the EU: If the CDN servers are located outside the European Union, you might be transferring data out of the EU,\nwhich adds another layer of GDPR compliance requirements.\nBy self-hosting, you ensure that user data doesn't leave the region unless you specifically choose a hosting solution outside the EU.\n\n\n\nContributing\nContributions are always welcome!\nIf you see areas of improvement or want to add features, please submit a PR.\nI'm especially interested in more translations.\nSee folder i18n for what's available and what is not.\nUse the file en.toml as a template for your own translations.\n\nLicense\nThis theme is under the MIT License.\nFor details, please refer to the LICENSE file.\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/themes/zolarwind/","title":"Zolarwind"},"https://www.getzola.org/themes/zolastrap/":{"body":"zolastrap\nA bootstrap theme for zola\nLive Demo\nconfig.toml [extra] variables\nbanner\n\ntype: string\ndefault: \"\"\n\nPath of a banner image, use empty string for no banner\ndate_format\n\ntype: string\ndefault: \"%d/%m/%Y\"\n\ndate format expression\ntheme\n\ntype: string\ndefault: \"default\"\n\none of the Bootswatch themes\nbg\n\ntype: string\ndefault: \"dark\"\n\none of the available backgrounds in\nBootstrap5\nfor navbar and footer\ninverted\n\ntype: boolean\ndefault: false\n\nInvert font for navbar and footer in case default choice is bad\nthemes\n\ntype: string\ndefault: \"Choose a Theme\"\n\nNavbar label for themes dropdown.\nThis dropdown will allow user to change\nBootswatch theme.\nUse empty string in case you do not want the user choose a theme.\nschemes\n\ntype: string\ndefault: \"Choose a Color Scheme\"\n\nNavbar label for schemes dropdown.\nThis dropdown will allow user to change footer and navbar\nbackground\ncolor.\nUse empty string in case you do not want the user choose a theme.\nsearch\n\ntype: string\ndefault: \"Search\"\n\nPlaceholder for navbar search input.\nRemember that to enable and disable search you should set variable\nbuild_search_index.\ntag\n\ntype: string\ndefault: \"Posts by Topic\"\n\nTaxonomy tag single label.

It features a large image or video on the left, accompanied by content on the right. Zplit is a port of Split by One Page Love for Zola.\n\nDEMO: https://zplit.netlify.app/\nInstallation\nDownload the theme to your themes directory:\n\nThen, enable the theme editing your config.toml:\n\nGetting started\nThe most important file of the theme is located in the root directory and is named =config.toml=. Edit this file to customize your preferences. Look for sections like [extra] to set variables like author, or [extra.content] to modify intro_tagline.\nIf something is unclear or not obvious, you might have missed the \"configuration\" section of the Zola official documentation. Even if you're new to static site generators, don't worry and take some time to go through the documentation, as it covers fundamental concepts.\nHere after, we will discuss two specific sections in more detail, because those are unique for the Zplit theme:\n\nBackground image\nLists (of links)\n\nBackground image\nEdit the [extra.visual] section to set your background image of choice.\n\nYou can find this example already written as the default:\n\nAs you can see, you can edit the relative position of the image, which is centered by default.\nLists\nYou can set up to 3 lists of links in the [extra.lists] section of the config.toml file:\n\nconnect\nsocial\nnetwork\n\nManipulating them is very easy: just add/remove elements in the TOML list, as showed in this example (also already present in the default file):\n\nDo you want another item? Just throw it up to the pile. You have no limits.\nRemember to set the url field with the link itself you want to direct your user at and a text to show in the page for the corrisponding URL.\nPosts\nTo add new posts, simply place markdown files in the content directory. In order to sort the post index by date, you need to enable the sort_by option in the content/_index.md file within the index section.\n\nThis theme was not specifically designed for blogging, but rather as a landing page for professionals. However, if you wish to blog using this theme, you certainly can. To do so, simply add a new section in the content directory and include it in the main menu through the config file. This will make it readily accessible to the user.\nThe theme does not offer support for taxonomies or other advanced features. It is focused on providing simple pages. If you wish to enhance the blogging functionality, you are welcome to customize the code or submit a specific request as an issue.\nCustom CSS\nTo make custom changes to the original stylesheets, you can create a custom.css file in the static directory. In this file, you can add any modifications or additions you desire.\nCustom colors\nIf you need to make adjustments to the colors or grid dimensions, it may be easier to modify the frontmatter of the _01-content.scss file directly. In this file, you will find variables conveniently located at the top:\n\nFeatures\n\n\nLightweight and minimal\n\nResponsive (mobile support)\n\nSocial links\n\nDeploy via Netlify (config already included)\n\nEasily extendable menus\n\nDe-googled (local assets are faster and more secure)\n\nNetlify support\n\nCustom CSS\n\nCustom colors\n\n404 page\n\nBasic blogging features\n\nOpen Graph and Twitter Cards support\n\nMultilanguage support\n\nSupport me!\nDo you love Zplit?

See a live preview here\n\nContents\n\nZulma\n\nContents\nInstallation\nJavascript\n\nSources\nBuilding\n\n\nOptions\n\nPagination\nTaxonomies\nMenu Links\nBrand\nSearch\nTitle\nTheming\n\n\nOriginal\nKnown Bugs\n\n\n\nInstallation\nFirst download this theme to your themes directory:\n\nand then enable it in your config.toml:\n\nThat's it! No more configuration should be required, however it might look a little basic. Head to the Options section to see what you can set for more customizability.\nJavascript\nSources\nAll the source javascript files live in javascript/src. Following is a list of the javascript files, their purpose, and their sources. All files are prefixed with zulma_ to avoid any name clashes.\n\nzulma_search.js - Used when a user types into the search box on the navbar (if enabled). Taken from Zola's site.\nzulma_navbar.js - Used for the mobile navbar toggle. Taken from the bulma template at Bulmaswatch\nzulma_switchcss.js - Used for swapping themes (if enabled).\n\nBuilding\nThe JavaScript files are transpiled by babel, minified by webpack, sourcemaps are generated and then everything placed in static/js. The repo already contains the transpiled and minified files along with their corrosponding sourcemaps so you don't need to do anything to use these. If you would prefer to build it yourself, feel free to inspect the js files and then run the build process (please ensure that you have node, npm and optionally yarn installed):\n\nGithub warnings\nYou may get warnings about vulnerabilities from the JavaScript dependencies. These shouldn't be an issue since we only have dev-dependencies and none of the them reach the end-user, but if you don't want to run the buld process yourself, and to stop Github pestering you about security warnings, feel free to delete the top level javascript folder when committing.\nOptions\nPagination\nZulma makes no assumptions about your project. You can freely paginate your content folder or your taxonomies and it will adapt accordingly. For example, editing or creating section (content/_index.md) and setting pagination:\n\nThis is handled internally, no input is needed from the user.\nTaxonomies\nZulma has 3 taxonomies already set internally: tags, cateogories and authors. Setting of any these three in your config.toml like so:\n\nand setting any of them in a content file:\n\nwill cause that metadata to appear on the post, either on the header for the name, or at the bottom for tags and categories, and enable those pages.\nMaking your own taxonomies is also designed to be as easy as possible. First, add it to your cargo.toml\n\nand make the corrosponding folder in your templates, in this case: templates\\links, and the necessary files: templates\\links\\list.html and templates\\links\\single.html\nAnd then for each, just inherit the taxonomy master page for that page. Before rendering the content block, you may optionally set a variable called title for the hero to display on that page, otherwise it will use the default for that taxonomy.\nIn single.html:\n\nIn list.html:\n\nMenu Links\nIn extra, setting zulma_menu with a list of items will cause them to render to the top menu bar. It has two paramers, url and name. These must be set. If you put $BASE_URL in a url, it will automatically be replaced by the actual site URL. This is the easiest way to allow users to navigate to your taxonomies:\n\nOn mobile, a dropdown burger is rendered using javascript. If the page detects javascript is disabled on the clients machine, it will gracefully degrade to always showing the menu (which isn't pretty, but keeps the site functional).\nBrand\nIn extra, setting zulma_brand will cause a brand image to display in the upper left of the top menu bar. This link will always lead back to the homepage. It has two parameters, image(optional) and text(required). image will set the brand to an image at the location specified, and text will provide the alt text for this image. If you put $BASE_URL in a url, it will automatically be replaced by the actual site URL. If image is not set, the brand will simply be the text specified.\n\nSearch\nZulma provides search built in. So long as build_search_index is set to true in config.toml then a search input will appear on the top navigation bar. This requires javascript to be enabled to function; if the page detects javascript is disabled on the clients machine, it will hide itself.\nThe search is shamefully stolen from Zola's site. Thanks, Vincent!\nTitle\nIn extra, setting zulma_title will set a hero banner on the index page to appear with that title inside.\n\nIf you want to get fancy with it, you can set an image behind using sass like so:\n\nThis will set the image behind the hero, and darken it so the main text can still be easily read.\nTheming\nIn extra, setting zulma_theme to a valid value will change the current colour scheme to that one. All themes were taken from Bulmaswatch. Valid theme values are:\n\ndefault\ndarkly\nflatly\npulse\nsimplex\nlux\nslate\nsolar\nsuperhero\n\nAll valid themes can also be found under the extra.zulma_themes variable in the theme.toml. Choosing no theme will set default as the theme. Setting an invalid theme value will cause the site to render improperly.\n\nAdditionally, in extra, you can also set the zulma_allow_theme_selection boolean. Setting this to true will allow a menu in the footer to allow users to select their own theme. This option will store their theme choice in their localstorage and apply it on every page, assuming zulma_allow_theme_selection is still true. This requires javascript to be enabled to function; if the page detects javascript is disabled on the clients machine, it will hide itself.\nEach theme contains the entirety of Bulma, and will weigh in at ~180kb. If you're running on a server severely limited on space, then I'd recommend you delete each theme you're not using, either from the source or from /public. Obviously, doing this will cause zulma_allow_theme_selection to work improperly, so make sure you either override extra.zulma_themes in config.toml to only show themes you have left or to not enable this option at all.\n\nOriginal\nThis template is based on the blog template over at Free Bulma Templates. All themes were taken from Bulmaswatch. The code behind from originally adapted from the after-dark zola template.\nKnown Bugs\n\nIf user theme swapping is enabled and the user selects a theme different to the default, a slight delay will be introduced in page rendering as the css gets swapped out and in by the javascript. This is particularly pronounced when using the dark theme, since it will flash white before going back to black. This is better than the alternative flashes of unstyled content or old theme, but still annoying.
