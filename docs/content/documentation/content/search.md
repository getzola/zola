Zola can build a search index from the sections and pages content to
be used by a JavaScript library such as [elasticlunr](http://elasticlunr.com/) or [fuse](https://www.fusejs.io).

To enable it, you only need to set `build_search_index = true` in your `config.toml` and Zola will
generate an index for the `default_language` set for all pages not excluded from the search index.

It is very important to set the `default_language` in your `config.toml` if you are writing a site not in
English; the index building pipelines are very different depending on the language.

As each site will be different, Zola makes no assumptions about your search function and doesn't provide
the JavaScript/CSS code to do an actual search and display results. You can look at how this site
implements it (using elasticlunr) to get an idea: [search.js](https://github.com/getzola/zola/tree/master/docs/static/search.js).


## Configuring the search index
In some cases, the default indexing strategy is not suitable. You can customize which fields to include and whether
to truncate the content in the [search configuration](@/documentation/getting-started/configuration/index.md).

## Index Formats

### Elasticlunr

Compatible with [elasticlunr](http://elasticlunr.com/). Also produces `elasticlunr.min.js`.

```toml
# config.toml
[search]
index_format = "elasticlunr_javascript" # or "elasticlunr_json"
```

If you are using a language other than English, you will also need to include the corresponding JavaScript stemmer file.
See <https://github.com/weixsong/lunr-languages#in-a-web-browser> for details.

### Fuse

Compatible with [fuse.js](https://www.fusejs.io/) and [tinysearch](https://github.com/tinysearch/tinysearch).

```toml
# config.toml
[search]
index_format = "fuse_javascript" # or "fuse_json"
```
