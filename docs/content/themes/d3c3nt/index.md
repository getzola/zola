# d3c3nt

d3c3nt is a simple, clean, and flexible theme for personal sites, made
by [FIGBERT] for the [Zola static site engine][zola]. This theme is
developed mainly for use on my personal site, so new features and styles
will be added when I stumble onto the need to make them.

All in all, it's fairly... decent.

## installation

To use d3c3nt in your own site, you have to add it to your `themes`
directory. You can do this in a variety of ways, but I recommend adding
it as a git submodule:

```
$ cd themes/
$ git submodule add git://git.figbert.com/d3c3nt.git
```

After installing the theme, set the top-level `theme` variable to
`"d3c3nt"` in your `config.toml`.

For more information about Zola themes in general, check out Zola's
[official site][zola-docs]. To find out more about d3c3nt's features and
configuration, head over to the [project's docs][docs].
