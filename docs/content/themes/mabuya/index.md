## ‚ìò Background

While searching for themes, I stumbled upon [Tale](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola). Unfortunately, the last update was on December, 2021. Soon after, I decided to fork the project and add my own touches to it.

The name **Mabuya** comes from the [Mabuya hispaniolae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabuya_hispaniolae?useskin=vector), a possibly extinct[^1] species of skink endemic to the Dominican Republic, my home country.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ Simple Blog
- ‚úÖ Pagination
- ‚úÖ Tags
- ‚úÖ Dark Theme and Toggle
- ‚úÖ Back-to-Top Button

## üìà Improvements

While working on the theme, I have added new functionality and made many quality of life improvements. Here's a short list:

- Refactored stylesheets to make it easier to [grok](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/grok).
- Added a dark theme and toggle.
- Added new footer navigation.
- Created a custom GitHub Action to deploy Zola sites faster than any other GitHub Actions without using Docker.
- Refined page transitions from desktop to mobile and viceversa.
- Centralized custom variables to make it easier to customize the site's colors.
- Addressed PR [#7](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola/pull/7) fixing the pagination problem present in the original Zola theme.
- Addressed Issue [#4](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola/issues/4) fixing custom text not being used correctly.
- Addressed (temporarily) Issue [#1](https://github.com/aaranxu/tale-zola/issues/1) by removing the erroneous pinned marker.
- Optimized for speed and accessibility. Subtle color changes to make the text more readable, etc.
- Many other small improvements eventually resulting in a perfect [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/about) score:

## üöÄ Quick Start

Before using the theme, you need to install [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) ‚â• v0.18.0. After which you'll need to:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:semanticdata/mabuya.git
```

2. Change directory into new cloned repository:

```bash
cd mabuya
```

3. Serve the site locally:

```bash
zola serve
```

For more detailed instructions, visit the [documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/) page about installing and using themes.

## üé® Customization

You can change the configuration, templates and content yourself. Refer to the [config.toml](config.toml), and [templates](templates) for ideas. In most cases you only need to modify the contents of [config.toml](config.toml) to customize the appearance of your blog. Make sure to visit the Zola [Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/).

Adding custom CSS is as easy as adding your styles to [sass/_custom.scss](sass/_custom.scss). This is made possible because SCSS files are backwards compatible with CSS. This means you can type normal CSS code into a SCSS file and it will be valid.
