# Zola  ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î Bear Blog

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/121b53ce-c913-4604-9179-eb3cca31cd2c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/zola-bearblog/deploys)

üß∏ A [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/)-theme based on [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev).

> Free, no-nonsense, super-fast blogging.

## Demo

This theme has multiple demo sites, to provide examples of how to set up deployment
- [Vercel](https://zola-bearblog.vercel.app/)
- [Netlify](https://zola-bearblog.netlify.app/)
- [Gitlab Pages](https://alanpearce.gitlab.io/zola-bearblog)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://zola-bearblog.pages.dev/)

When the user's browser is running ¬ªdark mode¬´, the dark color scheme will be used automatically. The default is the light/white color scheme. Check out the [`style.html`](https://codeberg.org/alanpearce/zola-bearblog/src/branch/main/templates/style.html)-file for the implementation.

## Installation

If you already have a Zola site on your machine, you can simply add this theme via

```
git submodule add https://codeberg.org/alanpearce/zola-bearblog themes/zola-bearblog
```

Then, adjust the `config.toml` as detailed below.

For more information, read the official [setup guide][zola-setup-guide] of Zola.

Alternatively, you can quickly deploy a copy of the theme site to Netlify using this button:

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://gitlab.com/alanpearce/zola-bearblog)

(Note that this method makes it harder to keep up-to-date with theme updates, which might be necessary for newer versions of Zola.)

## Adjust configuration / config.toml

Please check out the included [config.toml](https://codeberg.org/alanpearce/zola-bearblog/src/branch/main/config.toml)

## Content & structure

### Menu

Create an array in `extra` with a key of `main_menu`. `url` is passed to [`get_url`](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/templates/overview/#get-url)

```toml
[[extra.main_menu]]
name = "Home"
url = "@/_index.md"

[[extra.main_menu]]
name = "Bear"
url = "@/bear.md"

[[extra.main_menu]]
name = "Zola"
url = "@/zola.md"

[[extra.main_menu]]
name = "Blog"
url = "@/blog/_index.md"
```

### Adding / editing content

#### Index-Page

The contents of the `index`-page may be changed by editing your `content/_index.md`-file.


### Adding your branding / colors / css

Add a `custom_head.html`-file to your `templates/`-directory. In there you may add a `<style>`-tag, *or* you may add a `<link>`-tag referencing your own `custom.css` (in case you prefer to have a separate `.css`-file). Check out the [`style.html`](https://codeberg.org/alanpearce/zola-bearblog/src/branch/main/templates/style.html)-file to find out which CSS-styles are applied by default.

### Table of contents

Table of contents are not rendered by default. To render them, set `extra.table_of_contents.show = true` in `config.toml`.

The table of contents is rendered inside a `details` element.
If you want the section to be collapsed on page load, set `extra.table_of_contents.visible_on_load = false`.
This defaults to `true`.

In addition, `extra.table_of_contents.max_level` can limit the maximum level of headers to show.
To show only `h1`s, set `max_level = 1`, to show `h1`s and `h2`s, set `max_level = 2`, and so on.
By default, `max_level` is set to 6, so all headers on the page are shown.

Below is an example of how to configure the table of contents in `config.toml`.

```toml
[extra.table_of_contents]
show = true
max_level = 2
visible_on_load = false
```

It can also be toggled on page-by-page basis. Add `extra.hide_table_of_contents = true` to the page's frontmatter to hide the table of contents for that specific page.
