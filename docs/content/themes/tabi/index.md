## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> The fastest way to create a new site is to use the [tabi-start template](https://github.com/welpo/tabi-start). This gives you a complete blog setup with all the essential configuration ready to go.

### Manual installation

To add tabi to you existing Zola site:

0. Initialize a Git repository in your project directory (if you haven't already):

```
git init
```

1. Add the theme as a git submodule:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/welpo/tabi.git themes/tabi
```

Or clone the theme into your themes directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/welpo/tabi.git themes/tabi
```

### Required configuration

2. Enable the theme in your `config.toml`:

```
theme = "tabi"
```

3. Set a `title` in your `config.toml`:

```
title = "Your Site Title"
```

4. Configure code block highlighting in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[markdown]
highlight_code = true
highlight_theme = "css"
```

5. Create a `content/_index.md` file. This file controls how your home page looks and behaves. Choose one of the following options:

   **Option A: Serve posts from `/`**:

   ```
   +++
   title = "Home"
   paginate_by = 5  # Show 5 posts per page.
   +++
   ```

   - This will display posts in `content/` with pagination.

   **Option B: Serve posts from a different path (e.g., `blog/`)**:

   ```
   +++
   title = "Home"
   # Note we're not setting `paginate_by` here.

   [extra]
   section_path = "blog/_index.md"  # Where to find your posts.
   max_posts = 5  # Show 5 posts on the home page.
   +++
   ```

    - This will display the latest 5 posts from the `blog/` section.
    - Do not set `paginate_by` if you choose this option.
    - Use the full path to the section's `_index.md` file. Using `section_path = "blog/"` will not work.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not set both `paginate_by` and `section_path` in `content/_index.md`.
>
> These settings are mutually exclusive and using both may result in no posts being displayed.

6. If you want an introduction section (see screenshot above), add these lines to `content/_index.md`:

```
[extra]
header = {title = "Hello! I'm tabi~", img = "img/main.webp", img_alt = "Your Name" }
```

The content outside the front matter will be rendered between the header title and the posts listing. In the screenshot above, it's the text that reads "tabi is a fast, lightweight, and modern Zola theme‚Ä¶".

7. If you want a multilingual site, you will need to set up each language. In `config.toml`, set the title and taxonomies for each language, like:

```toml
[languages.es]
title = "~/tabi"
taxonomies = [{name = "tags", feed = true}]
```

You will need an `_index.{language_code}.md` per language for each section (e.g. /blog or /projects) that you want to enable in that language.

The same is true for individual posts, which should have the exact same name as the default language, with an extra `.{code}` before the extension (e.g. the Spanish version of `security.md` would be `security.es.md`).

This configuration allows the language switcher to take the user to the translation of the current URL. If a translation doesn't exist, the 404 page will be displayed, with an explanation in each language set in the config.

To learn more about multilingual support, see the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://welpo.github.io/tabi/blog/faq-languages/).

### Updating tabi

If you added the theme as a git submodule, run:

```bash
git submodule update --remote themes/tabi
```

If you cloned it:

```bash
cd themes/tabi
git pull
```
