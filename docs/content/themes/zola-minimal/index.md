It is based on the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme with [the same name](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal).

## 🚀 Quick Start

Before using the theme, you need to install [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) ≥ v0.18.0.

```sh
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:semanticdata/zola-minimal.git

# 2. Change directory into clone
cd zola-minimal

# 3. Serve the site locally
zola serve

# 4. Open http://127.0.0.1:1111/ in the browser
```

For more detailed instructions, visit the [Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/) page about installing and using themes.

## 🎨 Customization

You can change the configuration, templates and content yourself. Refer to the [config.toml](config.toml), and [templates](templates) for ideas. In most cases you only need to modify the contents of [config.toml](config.toml) to customize the appearance of your blog. Make sure to visit the Zola [Documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/).

Adding custom CSS is as easy as adding your styles to [sass/_custom.scss](sass/_custom.scss). This is made possible because SCSS files are backwards compatible with CSS. This means you can type normal CSS code into a SCSS file and it will be valid.
