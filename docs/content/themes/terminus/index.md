# Terminus

An accessible [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) theme with a dark color

score.

Terminus is largely a port of Radek Kozie≈Ç's [Terminal Theme for
Hugo](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) but with several key
differences. Credit to the [zerm](https://github.com/ejmg/zerm) and
[tabi](https://github.com/welpo/tabi) themes for inspiring some of these
changes.

* Better accessibility (WCAG 2.2 Level AA minimum target)

## Getting Started

### Manual Installation

1. Initialize a Git repository in your [Zola project directory], if you haven't
   already:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
2. Add the theme as a Git submodule:
   ```
   git submodule add https://github.com/ebkalderon/terminus.git themes/terminus
   ```
3. Enable the theme in your `config.toml`:
   ```toml
   theme = "terminus"
   ```
4. Set a website `title` in your  `config.toml`:
   ```toml
   title = "Your Site Title"
   ```
5. Create a text file named `content/_index.md`. This file controls how your
   home page looks and behaves. Choose _exactly one_ of the following options:
   1. **Serve blog posts from `/`:**
      ```markdown
      +++
      title = "Home"
      paginate_by = 5  # Show 5 posts per page.
      +++
      ```
   2. **Serve posts from a different path, e.g. `blog/`:**
      ```markdown
      +++
      title = "Home"

      [extra]
      section_path = "blog/_index.md"  # Where to find your posts.
      max_posts = 5  # Show 5 posts and a link to blog section on home page.
      +++
      ```
